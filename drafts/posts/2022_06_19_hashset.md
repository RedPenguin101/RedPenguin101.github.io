# A look at a Hashset library

I found a short [hashset](https://github.com/avsej/hashset.c) library in C, in less than 200 lines of code.

## Header file
Comprised of a structure `hashset_st`, and 6 public functions.

```c
hashset_t hashset_create(void);
void hashset_destroy(hashset_t set);
size_t hashset_num_items(hashset_t set);
int hashset_add(hashset_t set, void *item);
int hashset_remove(hashset_t set, void *item);
int hashset_is_member(hashset_t set, void *item);
```

The struct consists of 5 `size_t` and a `size_t*`.
1. `nbits`
2. `mask`
3. `capacity`
4. `*items`
5. `nitems`
6. `n_deleted_items`

Add and remove return integers depending on the 'success' of the operation. The membership fn returns 1 for yes, 0 for no.

## C File

The file starts with 2 unsigned integers

```c
static const unsigned int prime_1 = 73;
static const unsigned int prime_2 = 5009;
```

Next is create. It allocates a memory block the size of one hashset struct. The nbits is set to 3, capacity to 8 (I think). Mask to 7.
items is then allocated as a block of 8 `size_t`. I'm not sure what all these numbers are right now, but I guess we'll find out as we go.

nitems and n_deleted_items is set to 0.

```c
hashset_t hashset_create() {
  hashset_t set = calloc(1, sizeof(struct hashset_st));

  if (set == NULL) {
    return NULL;
  }
  set->nbits = 3;
  set->capacity = (size_t)(1 << set->nbits);
  set->mask = set->capacity - 1;
  set->items = calloc(set->capacity, sizeof(size_t));
  if (set->items == NULL) {
    hashset_destroy(set);
    return NULL;
  }
  set->nitems = 0;
  set->n_deleted_items = 0;
  return set;
}
```

Number of items functions and destroy are trivial.

Next is add member. It takes the set and the pointer to whatever the item is. The pointer is cast to a size_t. A hash is calculated with `7 & (73 * value)`

Next, we search for a 'free' slot in the set items (one where `set->items[ii]` is either 0 or 1), and set that slot to the value.

```c
static int hashset_add_member(hashset_t set, void* item) {
  size_t value = (size_t)item;
  size_t ii;

  if (value == 0 || value == 1) {
    return -1;
  }

  ii = set->mask & (prime_1 * value);

  while (set->items[ii] != 0 && set->items[ii] != 1) {
    if (set->items[ii] == value) {
      return 0;
    } else {
      /* search free slot */
      ii = set->mask & (ii + prime_2);
    }
  }
  set->nitems++;
  if (set->items[ii] == 1) {
    set->n_deleted_items--;
  }
  set->items[ii] = value;
  return 1;
}
```

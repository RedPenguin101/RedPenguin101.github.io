# Trying to Understand Football Part 1

I love football. But I don't really understand it. I know all the
positions and roughly what they do. I know the basic rules. I start to
get very lost when people start talking about tactics and play calls.
When I watch a play, I see a flurry of activity which I don't fully
understand, then the ball is in the hands of the receiver. I'd like to
know more, so I'm gong to try to educate myself about how football
plays _really_ work.

Starting with [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bPGDHkxPXE) play-by-play
analysis of Lamar Jackson's game against the Giants by Jackson Kreuger
(henceforth, JK), I'm going to try to understand what this says by
researching and documenting all the stuff I don't get.

It's starts on a 3rd and Goal in the redzone from the 13, with the
scores at zero (coaches film stamp 13.58). He says that this is a
man-coverage play. This one I know, but it's a good place for my first
definition Man vs. Zone:

## Man vs. Zone defense

In man coverage, each defender is assigned a _specific receiver_
on the opposing team to cover. Whereas in Zone, each defender is
assigned a part of the field to cover, and any pass catcher who strays
into that area is their responsibity.

The first things that jumps to mind is that, since this is all about
the backfield, this is presumably applicable to pass plays. Does it
make sense to talk about man vs. zone in the context of a run play? Or
do other concepts still apply?

The next question is: which defenders? All of them? I doubt this
includes the linemen, who I suppose are attacking the gaps in O-Line.
And any linebacker, corner or safety who is going after the
quarterback naturally can't be assigned a receiver or a zone. So I
think it must be all defenders who are dropping into coverage.

Next, how can you tell if a defense is in Man or Zone? The famous one
is that you send one of your receivers in motion, and if they are
followed, then it's man coverage. Are there any other signs before or
after the snap?

Relatedly, how do you disguise one type as another?

Then, what difference does it actually make? Like, _why_ alternate?
Is zone better for certain types of pass play, and man against
another? Is it a question of matchups? There seems to be a lot of
focus on being able to tell whether it's zone or man, but having
determined that, what action can the offense take based on that
information? Do they change the play?

What _are_ the zones? I saw a few hints that they correspond to
receiver routes (flat, go, etc.).

A few pros/cons from the Internet:

- ManPro: match up their best receivers with your best defenders
- ManPro: every receiver is accounted for, limiting the risk of a
  receiver being forgotton about and having an uncontested catch
- ManCon: Vulnerable to crossing routes (why?)
- ZonePro: Easier for less athletic players (why?)
- ZonePro: Defenders can afford to focus more on the QB and where he
  might be throwing, as opposed to on 'their guy', which can lead to
  interceptions
- ZoneCon: Possibility of confusion of responsibility leading to
  easy catches.

A couple of quotes from that thread that answer some of my questions:

> Good qbs ... try to take advantage of matchups based on coverage. If
> they recognize zone, they can guess the open spots of the field and
> anticipate throws to wrs. If man, they can take matchups they like

> Coverages heavily impact the run defense too...who and where
> defenders cover also impacts how involved they can be in the run
> defense, and where they can help from, so different coverages can be
> used to also set up different run defense structures or pursuit
> angles.

## Back to the play

So anyway, the Ravens are lined up with Hill in the backfield, X
receiver to the left, two TE on the right (Andrews and Likely) and
Flowers as the Y. Y moves closer in pre-snap, and the corner follows.
The Giants have 4 up front, one hands down Then LBs between the hashes
taking the RB, and TE. Two corners are 7y back on the X and Y. Then
two safeties. I guess this is what 'two high safeties' is?

![](../../images/football/2024_12_RvG_play_ps.png)

Here's what I see:

- The corners both stay on their assignments to the endzone
- Hill stays in to put an initial block, then stays around the 10,
  loosely shadowed by the Will
- Likely runs a crossing route about 3y in, followed quite far behind
  by the Sam (the Sam gets a bit jammed up on Andrews)
- Andrews goes to the 9, stops (which is what jams the Sam) with the
  Mike right in front of him and slightly to his left. He then heads
  past the Mike (right side) and into the endzone, where he gets the
  pass.
- Both safeties are moving towards Andrews by the time he's passed the
  Mike, but too late.

It actually almost looks like for a half second, the Mike and Sam were
confused about who they were supposed to be taking. I think maybe the
Mike saw that he was closer to Likely than the Sam, and the Sam was
closer to Andrews than him. And the Mike almost lets Andrew walk past
him, so that by the time he turns Andrews already has a step.

## 2nd play

## 3rd Play: 2nd and 9 from the 20, 0:36 to go in the second

Coaches film timestamp 38:00

Hill in the backfield, Likely and Andrews on the right again, but this
time Likely is on the _inside_ and a couple yards back from the line.
Then Flowers as the Y, and Bateman as the X, both quite narrow.

Giants are 4 up front, 3 with hands down. There's one high safety (I
think).

Pre snap, Likely motions to the left and no one follows. He's about
behind Bateman when the ball is snapped.

Flowers runs a 5y crossing route (and ends up wide open).
Hill sticks around for a sec and then gets to the line, then heads to
the right touchline (pretty leisurely - there's no-one within 5 yards
of him). Andrews runs a 10y Post. Bateman heads for the corner at
around the 5, which is where is he when Lamar throws it to him, and
it's caught near the back of the end-zone. Bateman has a couple of
steps on his safety the whole way.

Likely does a corner (I think?) and turns at the 10. Again, very open.



## New terms to follow up on later

- pick routes
- flood routes
- blitzing: what's the _actual_ definition?
- high safeties
- What is 'leverage'?

# On business books
Most business books are nearly entirely useless, because they are so limited in what they can say in their two to three hundred pages.

If I give you a book on "how to play football", which explains the offside rule, the positions, some tips on how to kick the ball, and then ask you to start for Real Madrid or any other professional team, you're going to have a bad time, because nearly nothing about playing at that level can be written down in simple, practical sentences. The rules _are_ like that, but they have trivial impact. The positional explanations, even when they go into some depth, will not capture a fraction of the nuance and history which goes into playing them. The tips on 'how to kick a ball' are useless unless backed up with hundreds of hours of practice. Overarching all of this is the reality that what is important is not 'how football is played', but how it is played _in the system you are in_. The crunchy stuff is all _local_, not generic.

Business books are similar. The rules they provide, the frameworks they espouse, the structures they describe: they are necessarily generic to the point that they can't have any practical value.

This is not to say that they have _zero_ value. The small value that they have is akin to providing stabilizers on a bike. They get you used to ideas of steering and peddling at the same time, get you used to the feel of it. You can't fall over but you are very limited in how fast you can go. Then when you are good enough you take them off.

Scrum[^1] was a good example of this for me. When I started learning about agile methods, I really had no idea what they were about. Scrum provided me with the rules, introduced me to the concepts, and provided a framework of roles and practices that theoretically aligned with the ideals. When we brought it into a team context (where no-one else on the team was familiar with it either) the ceremonies provided some structure where structure was needed.

Did this turn us into an effective team? Absolutely not. We misused all the roles. The ceremonies were performative. So what was the value of it? It provided stabilizers, a jumping off point. The value was not in the framework itself, but in the beginning of understanding[^2]. Over time the reading lead to other, better discussions of what agility in engineering meant, and why these methods arose. The practice on the team led us to gradually abandon the rules, titles and ceremonies, and just get into a pattern of working effectively together while trying to stick with what we see as the agile principles[^3].

[^2]: It should be acknowledged that Scrum does recognize this, at least theoretically, with its ideas of ShuHaRi. That these ideas are antithetical to the lucrative training courses they offer is neither here nor there.

[^3]: Impossible to adequately define, but broadly close and continuing collaboration with the people who will use the software, and quick feedback loops so that adjustments can be made quickly.

What is interesting is that it is axiomatic to the ideas underlying agile methods that _there should be no universal rules_, that agility is doing whatever you need to do to work effectively in your situation[^4]. As a consequence, the Scrum book contains, now that I look back on it, almost nothing that is of any value whatsoever. But even so, it was a key step on the path to understanding the subject. This same paradox can be generalized to any of the waters business books generally fish in. The books themselves are largely useless, but will typically be a first step in gaining understanding.

[^4]: This has parallels in nearly every field of practice, from lean production to Auftragstaktik.

The question must then be: _is it valuable to read them at all_? Could you achieve the same thing, more quickly, without the books, which after all all largely content-free?

Before tackling that question I want to turn to the types of business books which I think are most valuable. These are ones which do _not_ pretend to contain practical advice. The first type is the "business fable": a highly simplified, fictional narrative. Examples are _The Five Dysfunction of a Team_ by Lencioni, and _The Goal_, by Goldratt. The second type is the "experience report", in which someone describes the challenges of a job which they faced. The best example of this is Ohno Taiichi's _Toyota Production System_. I contrast these with "Practical Framework Descriptions", which synthesize and describe a way of doing things by presenting a process or rules which are intended to be used. _Scrum_ is an example of this.

The reason these are good is that the do not at any point present ideas that are disassociated from their local context. When Ohno is presenting his ideas about inventory minimization and defect prevention, he is doing so only ever in the context of the car plant he is running. In _The Goal_, the ideas are presented in the context of the plant. There is generally no implication that the author is saying "You should do x, y and z".

The longevity of the context thread is important. In both cases the thread of context is maintained long enough that the inevitable consequences of actions are visible, and dealing with those consequences is part of the book. This is how things tend to work in the real world: you implement some process, and that surfaces other things which must be dealt with. Compare this to the framework books, which will often provide examples to illustrate particular rules which they lay out, but will then move on to the next rule without properly exploring the example.

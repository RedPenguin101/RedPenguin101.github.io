% Article summary: MVP is old and busted

An article by Michael DeHaan: [Link](https://michaeldehaan.substack.com/p/minimal-viable-product-is-old-and?s=r)

Michael was the creator of _Ansible_, and later taught a college Senior Design course.

Minimum Viable Product ("MVP") is part of the startup religion, and is used all the time. MVP is a _product management strategy_, but it's used as a synonym for _software prototype_, or experiment.

Michael doesn't think MVPs work. His objection is that people have the mindset that, when you release the MVP, you don't know what the _product_ actually is yet. This (he says) is crazy.

> The whole MVP process presumes you don't know what you are making for a product, and that is death. You have no soul as a company at that point...

This seems to be the crux of the article: if you don't know what the product is _very_ early, you're going to fail. "Knowing the product" in this context being:

* Having a business model
* Having a pipeline
* Having a _huge_ amount of domain expertise
* Have enough insight into your customers that you know what _true_ requirements are, what is truly important to them. And by the same token, know the market

The approach advocated here (at least on paper) seems to oppose the "Lean Startup" mindset. The author says that a major pivot in your business should be viewed as a failure.

> Your company shouldn't be in search of a business model, you should know what you need to build. What until you see the exact right thing.

I think the lean startup response to this would be something like: You can _never_ know what the market is going to want until you start getting it out there. Do all the interviews you want, be the worlds greatest domain expert in whatever the product does. The market will take your assumptions and crap all over them. Until you start to see it, you have nothing but air.

The other theme of the essay is the incorrect emphasis people put on the MVP. The _minimal_ should not be the focus. The _viable_ and _product_ should be. If the MVP is unpolished enough to turn people away (and early users are easy to turn away), they will not buy, and not stay.

# The essentials

## The Gravitas Equation: Knowledge + purpose + passion - anxiety

`K + pu + pa - a`

* Knowledge (Logos) - Your area of expertise - you have something to say
* Purpose (Ethos) - your values, goals, character
* Passion (Pathos) - the spark

## Field Guide: recognizing gravitas

Knowledge:

* Does their knowledge extend to their physicality?
* Is the speech clear and well paced?
* Does their thinking seem logical, with clear signposts?
* Is the pace appropriate? Do you get lost or bored?

Purpose:
* Do you get the sense that they are ego driven, or serving common purpose
* Do you trust them? If not, why not?
* Are they being themselves?
* Do they have warmth?

Passion:
* Do they care about what they're saying?
* Are they empathic / attentive to the person they are talking to?
* What do you feel when they talk? Excitement? Fear? Calm? Tension? You feel what they feel
* What is your breathing like when they are speaking?

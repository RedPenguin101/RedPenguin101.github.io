=== Design principles

* Complexity is incremental. You have to sweat the small stuff
* Working code isn't enough
* Make continual small investments to improve system design
* Modules should be deep
* Interfaces should be designed to make the most common uses as simple as possible
* Simple interfaces are more important than simple implementation
* General purpose modules are deeper
* Separate general purpose and special purpose code
* Different layers should have different abstractions
* Pull complexity downwards
* Define errors and special cases out of existence
* Design it twice
* Comments should describe things that aren't obvious from the code
* Software should be designed for ease of reading not eas of writing
* The increments of software development should be abstractions not features

=== Red flags

* Shallow modules - the interface isn't much simpler than its implementation
* Information leakage - a design decision is reflected in multiple modules
* Temporal decomposition - the code structure is based on the order in which operation happen, not information hiding
* Over exposure - an API forces users to be aware of rarely used features in order to use commonly used features
* Pass through methods - A method does almost nothing except pass its arguments to a similar method
* Repetition - A non-trivial piece of code is repeated over and over
* Special-General mixture
* Conjoined methods - You can't understand one method without understanding the other, because of dependencies
* Comment repeats code
* Implementation documentation contaminates interface
* Vague name

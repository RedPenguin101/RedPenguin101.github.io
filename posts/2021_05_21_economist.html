<div id="content">
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_leaders">Leaders</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_race_in_america">Race in America</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Flloyd&#8217;s death prompted the biggest civil rights protest in American history. Chauvin was convicted of murder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What needs to change?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite gains in legal and political rights, measures of relative poverty and segregation haven&#8217;t moved in 50 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three causes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>secular economic trends</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aftershocks of slavery and segregation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>present day bigotry and racism</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first two are the biggest causes, but the last gets most attention. Covid-19 has killed blacks disproportionately, but it&#8217;s unlikely that racist doctors are to blame. Due to past racism and present poverty, blacks are more likely to suffer from pre-existing conditions, and less safe work environments, less likely to have health insurance.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_poverty_policy">Poverty Policy</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rooting out entrenched racist views is largely not in the power of government. Poverty and structural racism are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Biden&#8217;s new child tax credit expects to reduce child poverty by 40%, and halve the number of poor black children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This colorblind legislation is preferable to racially targetted ones. First, it is more likely to get broad backing from the public. Second, helping all poor Americans is beneficial in general, and helps blacks disproportionately. The ACA has reduced the number of uninsured African Americans by 40%.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Policies aimed generally at poverty are morally preferable: Not all blacks need help. Other minorities with similar conditions will also be helped: Latino, Native American, Asian.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_police_reform">Police reform</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There have been advances in the last year. "Qualified Immunity" has been trimmed in many places. While presented as a racial issue, police killings of all unarmed men is higher than it should be. Separating unjustified killings should be seen as a nation priority, and a civil rights issue affecting all Americans.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_organizations">Organizations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Companies and Universities should pay more attention to race when hiring. But, where practical, a race-neutral approach would be better for America, and especially its African American citizens.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_future">The Future</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next 50 years the US will become the first big, rich country where no single racial, ethnic or religious group will be in the majority. If politicians exploit the tribal fears this raises, the transition will be turbulent.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_job_vacancies_in_the_rich_world">Job vacancies in the rich world</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As they come out of the pandemic, businesses are shouting about labor shortages. But unemployment is high and not dropping. Why the mismatch?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some see this as good. Companies are boosting wages to attract workers. Pay growth is a strong 3% in the US. Qualification requirements are being dropped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a downside: a bidding war for workers could cause an inflationary spiral. A labour shortage means products that are wanted won&#8217;t get produced. Having people sitting idle is a waste of talent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Governments should consider:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Payments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patience</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Business people are convinced that unemployment insurance and benefits are the cause of the shortage. The evidence for this is slim. Australia has ditched its payouts, and still has the same problem - in fact shortages have worsened. UI should be redesigned to encourage work. Making one-off payments to people who find work, for example, has had good results in past recessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immigration has been slashed during the pandemic. This is a price-tag that must be accepted or reversed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, just waiting for more people to get comfortable with going to work should show results.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_italy_might_get_a_hard_right_government">Italy might get a hard right government</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In February, Draghi became PM. Italian debt yields has only a 1.2pp premium on Germany&#8217;s, his government has a large majority in parliament, and the EC is about to give him a huge amount in C19 recovery funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Italian politics is unpredictable. Populists are seizing on an increase in boat migrants. Salvini&#8217;s Northern League, still the most popular party in the country, is losing ground to an even more radical outfit, the Brothers of Italy (FdI), which has roots in the Fascist movement. The FdI has overtaken Letta&#8217;s Democrats, the main center-left party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The FdI, League and Berlusconi could probably get enough votes to form a coalition government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout Europe, having the hard-right in power is becoming less unthinkable. Le Pen is neck and neck with Macron. Spain&#8217;s Peoples Party is seeking a deal with Vox in the Madrid region.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sustainable_finance_is_a_mess">Sustainable Finance is a mess</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The private sector has a hard-on for green investing. Green firms, like solar panel firms and hydrogen fuel producers, have seen share prices rocket, with 6 doing better than Tesla since the start of 2019. Big companies boast about their green credentials. Assets Managers are selling ESG products - inflows for these are a quarter of the total, up from a tenth in 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ESG funds suffer from Greenwashing. The 20 biggest ESG funds hold 17 fossil fuel producers on average, including Exxon and Saudi Aramco. Gambling, alcohol and tobacco holdings are also common. The SEC worries that investors are being mislead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The EU&#8217;s Green Deal includes rules about sustainable finance, telling investors what is green and what isn&#8217;t. This has been subject to political forces, with countries lobbying to have nationally important industries, including natural gas, included.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, investors should decide for themselves what is green. But to make this practical, better disclosure is needed. Current reporting is largely voluntary, and full of holes. Obscurantist puffery is common. A manager should be able to figure out the carbon footprint of their holdings, but this is not disclosed rigorously, and how to aggregate results is unclear. There should clear an mandatory guidelines for this disclosure.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_eritrea_on_the_march">Eritrea on the march</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ethiopia&#8217;s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and Eritrea&#8217;s president, Issaias Afwerki, are partners in a bloody war in Tigray.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two countries were formerly at war. Abiy won a nobel peace prize for brokering a peace in 2019. He was seen as a force for liberalization and democracy. Issaias is an aging and violent dictator. The peace seemed to bode well for Eritrea also. Sanctions were lifted, cash poured in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Things have soured since. Encouraged by promises of support from Issaias, Abiy attacked Tigray, in what has now devolved into a bloody stalemate. War crimes against civilians by Eritrean and Ethiopian troops in Tigray are common. Food and farming supplies to the region have been cut off. Issaias is the winner from this. His troops are deep in Ethiopian territory, including along its border with Sudan, which Eritrea has a separate beef with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Issaias seems to be encouraging despotic behaviour in Ethiopia, and also in Somalia, encouraging the president there to overstay his term limit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The West is slowly cancelling the recent opening up to Eritrea, though few hold out hope that it will have much impact: the country is used to isolation. Pressure on Abiy may be more successful though.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="_usa">USA</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_american_welfare_state">The American Welfare State</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Biden is proposing an ambitious European-style expansion of the safety-net, the American Families Plan, at a cost of $1.8trn. It includes</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Child allowance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid family leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>universal pre-school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subsidized child care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>free community college</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This reflects a shift in the Democratic party over the last 20 years. Clinton-era democrats were largely on-board with Reaganite ideas of limited government assistance. These days they are not. Several factors are contributing to the shift:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>general worries about inequality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>changes in the views of economists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a leftward shift in the party</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOP abandonment of fiscal responsibility in the Trump era.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recent spending splurges following C19</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Polls show broad support from Republicans on pre-school, clean energy research, and child allowance (though not on a public option for health insurance).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Poverty reduction has tepid support across the board. What is popular are programs aimed at the middle class, which the poor also benefit from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the AFP is a good plan, but could use some trimming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One in six American children live in poverty, among the highest in the rich world. Support for young people is flimsy (the elderly get Social Security and Medicare). Child allowance is the main anti-child-poverty tool in rich countries, and America doesn&#8217;t have one. The AFP would extend a recent C19-bill payment plan ($3k pa per child) beyond its 1 year duration, to 2025. This is expected to halve child poverty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The paid family leave allowance, almost universal in the rich world, would guarantee 12 weeks of paid maternity leave, costing $225bn over the next 10 years. Improvements in infant health and maternal health from this are well demonstrated outside of the US and within in, in state programs such as California&#8217;s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Universal pre-school for 3-4 year olds has a bill of $200bn. Small scale pre-school initiatives have impressive results, though it remains to be seen how well it scales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other parts of the AFP are more questionable. Child care is already incredibly expensive in the US. The white house believes subsidies would improve this, but it is also possible it will merely push up prices and reduce quality of care. A study of Quebec&#8217;s program of subsidised child care found that child behaviour was worsened, and parents were less caring and had worse health.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The far left of the Dems has much more radical aspirations, including cancellation of student debt and regressive subsidies of college courses which are mostly attended by the rich. Nonetheless, this is the biggest social policy experiment since the 60s.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_silicon_valley_and_politics">Silicon valley and politics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most people try to keep work and politics separate. Techland is different. Internal forums debate politics and social issues. Some firms, including Facebook, Google and Shopify, are pushing back. Basecamp caused a stir (and lost a lot of employees) by declaring itself 'politics free'</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Silicon valley had roots in the counterculture of the 60&#8217;s, and tech shifts often intersect with social issues - the FOSS movement for example. More recently, employees have started expecting workplaces that align with their personal values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pendulum is swinging back. Slack is not a great place to put across nuanced views. Moderators have had to be put in place. Workers are vocal and management are defensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A recent poll suggests two-thirds of adults want to be able to discuss racial-justice issues at work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_children_divorcing_parents">Children divorcing parents</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Estrangement between family members is common in America. A recent survey found 27% of adults are estranged from a close family member - though it is thought that this under-reports the true number because of the shame of admitting it. There isn&#8217;t much historical research on it, so it&#8217;s not clear what the trend is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common estrangement is between parent and child, usually with the child initiating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A rise in individualism emphasising personal happiness, displacing filial duty is the biggest factor. This is emphasised in America, which is more individualistic than most rich countries, has a commensurately higher divorce rate, as well as a fair amount of inter-state mobility.</p>

<h3 id="_cdc_guidance_and_americas_vaccination_rate">CDC guidance and America&#8217;s vaccination rate</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CDC this week rolled back mask requirements for vaccinated Americans. Possibly this was an incentive to get vaccinated. But vaccination rates are slowing despite an ample supply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Possibly the announcement is a reaction to criticism by public health officials of previous overcaution by the CDC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The announcement was criticized as being out-of-bounds of the CDCs responsibility. The CDC is supposed to provide scientific advice, not announce policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably it will act as a <em>disincentive</em> for vaccination. Minnesota was encouraged enough to remove all mask requirements (except for child-care and schools), regardless of vaccination status. Many states are following th guidance to remove mask requirements for vaccinated people without procedures for checking vaccination status, effectively removing all mask requirements.</p>

<p>Despite opposite policies, America&#8217;s results in the Middle East have been largely the same under Obama and Trump. Both tried and failed to scale back commitments in the region. Biden will try the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The violence in Palestine this week is a test of that resolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite being a rare Democratic Zionist, Biden will not be ditching the Palestinians. He restored $250m in aid that Trump but. He has promised to reopen the consulate in Jerusalem that Trump closed. But he views the peace cause as a losing one under the current leadership of both sides, and says he won&#8217;t be spending much time on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The administration was slow to respond to events. Its strategy is supportive of the status quo, resisting calls from the left to pressure Israel. It has not called for a ceasefire, or allowed the UNSC to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The administration is going the quiet diplomacy route. It believes Obama&#8217;s attitude to Netanyahu was counterproductive. Instead it hopes to gain leverage on him by providing early support which it can later threaten to withdraw. It hopes that growing antipathy to his cause on the left will provide further leverage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The administration does have ambitions to restore the Iran nuclear agreement, which affects its ME moves. All powers in the region will be looking to Biden&#8217;s reaction as an indicator willingness to stand by its allies.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Poots has some difficult road ahead. The Irish Sea border for example. He hopes unionists will win a majority in Stormont next year and vote it down. This looks unlikely at this point. The DUP is losing support to other Union parties.</p>

<p>growing nationwide demand for <em>guoxue</em> - national studies. Classical Chinese thought, texts, morals, especially Confucian ones. Behaviour: bowing, greeting, sitting. Traditional dying techniques and calligraphy, tea and chess. But building character is the main goal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Confucius was vilified during the 20th C, in the belief that it was blocking progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Driven in part by a sense of cultural loss. Rediscovering heritage. But it also now meshes with official objectives. Respect for authority, deference to elders. Emperors used it to instil obedience. Xi wants that. It is also intrinsically Chinese, so plays well with increasing nationalism and growing cultural self-confidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Others see Confucian morals as salves for modern social problems. They encourage calm and focus in children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also a reaction to the national obsession with exams. Guoxue is a way to distinguish children in the rat race, and to shield them from relentless competition early on.</p>

<p>Traditionally male preference in Chinese families. Girls were married off and left the family. Girl babies were often killed. A male heir was needed. There was another way for rich, male-less families: recruit a poor man as a live-in son-in-law. The man agreed to take the wifes name and take care of his parents-in-law in preference to his own parents. This was banned between the 13th and 17th C. The practice was subject to social scorn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modern China is more pragmatic. A new national census shows that China is aging fast, and has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. The population will soon be shrinking. The effects of the since-revoked one child policy will endure. 111 boys are born for every 100 girls.</p>

<p>The EU machinery has praised Greece for its handling of the pandemic. This is a big shift for the thrice bailed-out country, which was seen as the rebel of the bloc in the far-left Syriza days of 2015-19.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mitsotakis of New Democracy, the center-right PM since 2019, has set himself up as a friend of the technocratic EU world. He was elected on an implicit mandate to make Greece into a "normal European country" again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A decade on from the EU crises, Greece had its finances in order long before C19. Bond years are near record lows. The ECB willingly buys its debt. Ivy league nerds run the show. Years of bludgeoning means that Greek officials know how to tick the EUs boxes - its plan for spending EU19 funds was thousands of pages long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Greece might have blotted its record with the dire conditions imposed on migrants on islands, as well as illegal "pushbacks" to source countries. But the harshness seems to suit Brussels. VDL hailed Greece as "Europe&#8217;s shield".</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The comeback is part of a broader trend of strong growth in 2nd-tier tech companies, even relative to that of the 1st tiers. This confounds the predictions of many that tech would be a winner-takes-all industry, with a few firms taking all the pie.</p>

<p>Technology adoption and cloud computing has allowed forms to specialise, creating big markets. Twilio provides text, voice and video comms to 200k other firms, including other tech firm.

<p>T2 firms are getting better at building 'platforms' - an closed ecosystem of users which enable buyers and sellers to transact. Doing so generates network effects and virtuous circles (called flywheels in the jargon), and providing moats against copycats (including the 1st tiers). Shopify doesn&#8217;t compete with Amazon.

<p>Crypto had a tough week. Tether&#8217;s admitted just 2.9% of its coins are cash backed, calling its dollar peg int question. Tesla stopped accepting BitCoin over environmental concerns. China warned its financial industry away from crypto. Bitcoin fell to $30k, down by half from April, dragging most other coins with it. Many exchanges couldn&#8217;t handle the volumes, calling into question the markets suitability for institutional investors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Banks are venturing into cryptoland. Goldman relaunched its cryptodesk, shut down in 2017. Citi, BNY, StateStreet and JPM are all making noises. Why? First, American regulators have been setting out what services banks can provide, which gives some firmer ground to stand on. They say custodial services are OK, and derivatives which reference coins (classified as commodities) can be traded.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mainly though, banks are interested because customers are interested (maybe obsessively). Many who traditionally work through banks want to invest, but right now have to do so through fintechs and startups. They would be more comfortable if the banks could handle it.</p>

<p>The derivatives and custody parts are simple enough - though the latter requires significant tech investment. The next level is where banks hold crypto on their balance sheets.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It provides "fixes" for 5 currencies daily for various periods. It will stop fixing all except USD at the end of 2021, and USD from June 2023, after the 2012 manipulation scandal. A replacement is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a long list of candidates. The leading ones are</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>For GBP: The Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Yen: The Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For CHF: The Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For EUR: The Euro Short Term Rate (ESTR)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All are 'risk-free' rates. But there are some differences. SONIA ESTR and TONAR are based on the unsecured deposits banks in the respective regions use for daily liquidity. American and Swiss banks rely on repos, and SOFR/SARON are based on that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are alternatives to SOFR, whic might be OK for big national US banks, but not so much for regional banks that rely on unsecured debt and don&#8217;t use repos much. For them, AMERIBOR, which is based on lending rates of these banks, is available. Indices produced by Bloomerg and ICE are based on long-term bond yields, for banks that use that more than repos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These other indices for USD, though, have the same problems as LIBOR did: if the transactions which it references dry up the rates get iffy. The repo market, on the other hand, is ginormous, at $1trn per day. AMERIBOR and ICE equivalents are $2.5bn and $15bn respectively.</p>

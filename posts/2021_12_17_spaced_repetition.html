<ol type="1">
<li>Compute <strong>startup interval</strong> using <strong>first forgetting curve</strong></li>
<li>After interval, make a <strong>repetition</strong></li>
<li>After repetition, compute new <strong>difficulty</strong></li>
<li>Estimate <strong>retrievability</strong></li>
<li>Estimate <strong>stability</strong></li>
<li>Compute new <strong>optimum interval</strong> using <strong>stabilization curve</strong></li>
<li>Update <strong>memory matrices</strong> (stabilization matrix and recall martix)</li>
<li>Go to 2</li>
</ol>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complicated for a first pass.</p>
<h2 id="leitner-system">Leitner System</h2>
<p><a href="https://e-student.org/leitner-system/">Link</a></p>
<p>This is by far the simplest system I came across. It’s a ‘box based system’ rather than a ‘card based system’. As in the reviews are on <em>boxes of cards</em> rather than on the cards themselves.</p>
<p>There are 3 boxes. As you start reviewing the cards, the order of the cards in the box is changed.</p>
<p>Box 1 (the “every day box”) contains new cards, and cards from box 2 that were answered incorrectly. Every card in box 1 should be answered every day. Cards from box 1 that are answered incorrectly stay in box 1, cards that are answered correctly go to box 2.</p>
<p>Box 2 contains cards from box 1 that were answered correctly, and cards from box 3 that were answered incorrectly. Box 2 is reviewed every other day.</p>
<p>Box 3 contains cards from box 2 that were answered correctly, and cards from box 3 that were answered correctly. Cards in box 3 are reviewed once per week.</p>
<p>This has the benefit of simplicity, and extensibility. Adding a box 4 with a repetition of one month is trivial.</p>
<p>The biggest downside I can thing of is that it seems to make ‘lumps’ in review. i.e. you’ll have a big lump of cards to review when the month comes up.</p>
<p>I think a mitigation of this would be card base system which tags cards with boxes, like this:</p>
<pre><code>Repetition = card-id, next-review-date, box
Review :: Repetition, correct? -&gt; Review
NewDate :: current-date, box, correct? -&gt; new-date</code></pre>
<p>The <code>NewDate</code> function would calculate the new date based on the current box. The <code>Review</code> function would calculate the new review date, and the new box (incremented or decremented) based on the response. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>review(old-rep, correct?):
  new-rep = new Repetition
  new-rep.card-id = old-rep.card-id
  new-rep.box = old-rep.box + (if correct? 1 else -1) 
  new-rep.date = new-date(old-rep.date, old-rep.box, correct?)
  return new-rep</code></pre>
<p>One thing that Anki had which I think is worth emulating is that <em>any</em> card that you get wrong goes back into box 1, regardless of its current box. So the function would be like <code>new-rep.box = if correct? old-rep + 1 else 1</code></p>

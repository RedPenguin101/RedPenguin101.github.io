<p>Tacit knowledge is knowledge that cannot be captured through words alone. Like riding a bike.</p>
<p>The idea that you can transmit any technique through explanation (thus denying that tacit knowledge exists) is called <em>transmissionism</em>. That if you find the right combination of words, the student will understand. The author derides this view.</p>
<p>How, then, does one teach tacit knowledge? Verbal instruction is obviously of limited use. Emulation and action. “You learn by copying what the master does, blindly, until you internalize the principles behind the actions.”</p>
<p>This is clearly a match for physical activities. What about mental ones, knowledge work? It is applicable there too. There are many cases in knowledge work where an expert is not able to explain why they have made the decisions they did, to the extent that the expertise could be passed on purely by explanation.</p>
<p>The pattern in such explanations is: they start with principles and heuristics, but as you dig down, very quickly you get to so many exceptions, caveats and gotchas that the principles seem meaningless. Until eventually you bottom out with “it just feels right.”</p>
<p>The way to gain expertise in this condition is to try to copy them, then ask for their feedback on that specific thing, so that you can hear the long caveat list.</p>
<p>Should we try to make tacit knowledge explicit? No, let’s not bother. It might technically be possible, but at the least it’s so difficult, and there are good enough alternatives, that it’s not worth the effort.</p>
<p>[Side note: reminds me of the philosophy/science problem, where philosophy can’t seem to answer any questions, but this is only because once those questions become tractable, they by definition stop becoming philosophy and start becoming science. Thus problems of philosophy are by definition unanswerable, but trying to do so is not wasted effort]</p>
<p>In the 70’s: the ‘expert systems’ initiatives. Basically an effort to write down the work of humans in an explicit way. It failed. So many branches, so many exceptions, that any documentation would become so difficult to navigate it would be impractical to use. (aka the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#Disadvantages">knowledge acquisition problem</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common disadvantage cited for expert systems in the academic literature is the knowledge acquisition problem. Obtaining the time of domain experts for any software application is always difficult, but for expert systems it was especially difficult because the experts were by definition highly valued and in constant demand by the organization. As a result of this problem, a great deal of research in the later years of expert systems was focused on tools for knowledge acquisition, to help automate the process of designing, debugging, and maintaining rules defined by experts. However, when looking at the life-cycle of expert systems in actual use, other problems – essentially the same problems as those of any other large system – seem at least as critical as knowledge acquisition: integration, access to large databases, and performance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other problems are that such an encoding results in fragile systems. i.e. strict rule following requirements prevent both the use of and the development of expertise.</p>
<p>There are perhaps some isolated exceptions to this. Occasionally a rare genius will appear who <em>can</em> go a long way to making tacit knowledge explicit. But this is not generalizable.</p>
<h1 id="deliberate-practice">Deliberate Practice</h1>
<p>DP is arguably the hot topic in the field of expertise development.</p>
<p>The Author, in <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/peak-book-summary/">other</a> <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-problems-with-deliberate-practice/">articles</a>, has claimed that deliberate practice is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>possible only in domains with a long history of well-established pedagogy. In other words, deliberate practice can only exist in fields like music and math and chess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many knowledge fields, no established pedagogical techniques exists. Deliberate practice is therefore of limited use. The better way to gain expertise is: find a master, learn under them for a few years.</p>

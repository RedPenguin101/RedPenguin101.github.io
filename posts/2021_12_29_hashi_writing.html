<p><a href="https://works.hashicorp.com/articles/writing-practices-and-culture">link</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>we write to clarify our ideas, to articulate concepts to our colleagues both within and beyond our teams, and to gather the feedback we need to make those ideas better.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-write-proposals-and-solution-documents">Why write proposals and solution documents?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clarify ideas</li>
<li>articulate concepts to colleagues</li>
<li>Gather feedback</li>
<li>Encourage thoughtfulness</li>
<li>Easy access to context on what a decision is, how it was made</li>
<li>Ease of operation across timezones</li>
<li>Equalizing force: change proposal process is same for engineers and founders</li>
<li>Allows proper credit for ideas</li>
<li>Allows people less likely to speak up in meetings to be heard</li>
<li>Avoids long, circular meetings</li>
<li>Makes decisions more efficient: Come to the meeting having read the doc, yay or nay vote is often enough</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-do-they-write">What do they write?</h2>
<p>Problem Requirements Document (PRD): Defines the problem. The ‘Why’. Request for Comment (RFC): Proposes the solution</p>
<h2 id="prd">PRD</h2>
<p><a href="https://works.hashicorp.com/articles/prd-template">PRD Template</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Usually PMs will write the PRD</li>
<li>Helps team members fully understand a problem and define what’s needed to address it.</li>
<li>Helpful for working through an ambiguous challenge with many stakeholders</li>
<li>Curating information, not creating it.</li>
<li><em>Before</em> a PRD, you should do research.</li>
<li>Offer a clear problem statement and insight into the problem</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A PRD reader should clearly understand what the problem is, who it affects, and why it is important to solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="template-content">Template content</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Explains the goal of the PRD. Summarizes the content. <em>Do this last</em></li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: Provide useful context about the problem domain. Context is essential for understanding content. Use visuals if possible</li>
<li><strong>Problem Statements</strong>: The heart of the PRD. Include <em>Personas</em></li>
<li><strong>Phases and requirements</strong>: Break the problem into phases to allow iterative development.
<ul>
<li>Phases should be independently valuable</li>
<li>Each phase should have one or more requirements / success criteria.</li>
<li>1 sentence description for each phase and each requirement</li>
<li>Requirements should have an acceptance criteria, written like test cases. Make as unambiguous as possble</li>
<li>Requirements should have considerations section, to be used by the RFC writer. Almost always a question.</li>
<li>Each phase should build on the previous ones.</li>
<li>State in decreasing order of value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>User research</strong>: The most important section. Grounds the PRD in real experience. One section for each customer. Include a link to interview notes, and a para summarizing state of workflow and key takeaways.</li>
<li><strong>Approvals</strong>: All stakeholders must approve the PRD before it goes for RFC.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="rfc">RFC</h2>
<p><a href="https://works.hashicorp.com/articles/rfc-template">RFC Template</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Usually Engineers will write the RFC</li>
<li>Again, articulate and get feedback on solution</li>
<li>Not <em>Mandatory</em> to have an RFC. Generally for bigger, more complex work, or requiring buy-in from many stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-for-writing-and-feedback">Tips for writing and feedback</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write with a buddy if you haven’t written one before</li>
<li>Collaborate early and often</li>
<li>Don’t worry about it being perfect</li>
<li>Follow the template. The consistency will make it easier for reviewers to review</li>
<li><strong>Don’t put too much detail</strong>. Be concise</li>
<li>Acknowledge and resolve each comment, even those you decide not to act on.</li>
<li>If feedback seems off, ask questions about what the commenter meant</li>
<li>Feel free to have brainstorming sessions before writing. The PRD is the artifact, not the process</li>
<li>For RFC, sometimes an ‘options exploration’ step after PRD is good.</li>
<li>If comments are not resolving, get on a Zoom. Easier to do in person.</li>
</ul>

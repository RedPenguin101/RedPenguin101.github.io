<p>Hiding behind outdated reporting rules.</p>

<p>The way big tech monetize information is very obscure. According to a new UCL report, they are using this to get around SEC 10K disclosure rules. Or, the SEC disclosure rules are inadequate for this type of product. The SEC rules have a hole around the value of the data that tech platforms extract, because the rules focus on products that <em>directly</em> generate revenue.</p>
<p>Tech firms often do disclose their own measures for these types of products: Monthly active users, user engagement, customer acquisition costs, etc. Other SEC disclosures have <em>segment</em> or <em>division</em> grain requirements, but since the tech products aren’t covered, the grain of disclosure is up to the companies. For example, YouTube was not called a “separate division” of Alphabet, and the AppStore was not called a “separate division” of Apple. In both cases the companies used this to justify not reporting these products separately.</p>
<p>All this makes it hard for regulators, investors, and other stakeholders to understand the market positions of the tech giants, to the detriment of them and of society.</p>
<p>The SEC, as well as the EU, are thinking about how to solve this problem by increasing reporting requirements.</p>

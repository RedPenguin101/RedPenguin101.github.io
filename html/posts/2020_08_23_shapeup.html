<h1 id="summary-of-shape-up">Summary of Shape Up</h1>
<p><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook">Link to the
book</a></p>
<p>This book describes a method for structuring a software engineering
department for building software products in six week cycles. The
primary audience is the ‘designer’, or ‘shaper’ - basically the product
owner / business analyst in our context. The bulk of content is in this
first design phase, though it does have something to say about the
actual development process in part 3, in particular the designers role
as a manager/monitor during this phase.</p>
<p>The ideal team here is 1 designer, 2 developers. The designer is the
product owner, and is also in a sense a ‘manager’ of the devs (though a
<em>very</em> hands off one).</p>
<p>Basecamp, the firm behind the book, build user facing application,
with a web-based front end and a back end. The implementation here is
somewhat tied to that idea that there will be something that the user
will be interacting with. For any project which doesn’t fit that mold,
the design process will need to be modified.</p>
<p>The devs will be nearly entirely autonomous and self-managing during
the build process. You need to have a lot of trust in the developers.
For that reason this won’t work well with contracted resources. It will
also (like every other methodology) work much better if the team is a
fixed one, and you’re not setting up the team-of-three specifically for
the project, and everyone is used to working with one another.</p>
<p>The process of development starts with the raw idea. The feature that
is proposed or the problem the user is having. From there it goes
through 3 stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Shaping, where the designer takes the raw idea and produces a design
pitch</li>
<li>Betting, where decision makers look at the pitched options and
decide what will be worked on in the next cycle.</li>
<li>Building, where the devs build the thing in a 6 week cycle and
deploy it at the end.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="week-work-cycles">6 week work cycles</h2>
<p>Six weeks, because 2 week sprints are too short and come with too
much admin overhead. Plus, in a 6 week window, you’re likely to be able
to get something much more meaningful done, and done from start to end.
But it still gives that focusing deadline to work on.</p>
<p>Between each cycle there’s a 2 week cool-down, with no scheduled
work. Devs are free to work on what they want (that is work related).
It’s also a time to work on bugfixes etc.</p>
<p>There are a couple of pre-requisites. First, the time-box is
uninterrupted dev time, with the team working only on that. They don’t
get pulled away to fix bugs or anything else. You need to get and
maintain <em>momentum</em>. Worst case, you have to wait 6 weeks to deal
with a bug and do it in cool-down.</p>
<p>If it’s a true everything’s-fucked crisis, then just break the whole
cycle. But this should be very rare.</p>
<p>Second, if a team doesn’t ship after 6 weeks, it doesn’t get
extended. The project failed. You have to re-pitch. This is called the
<strong>circuit breaker</strong>. The goal is that you have a fully
clean slate with every cycle. Never carry over scraps.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-the-designer-receives-the-raw-idea-and-shapes-it-into-a-design-which-is-distilled-into-a-pitch">Step
1: The Designer receives the raw idea and shapes it into a Design, which
is distilled into a pitch</h2>
<p>You’re trying to end up with a design at a medium level of fidelity -
more detailed than just words, but not wire frames. You’re trying to
convey the <em>boundaries</em> around the thing, where you have
intentionally set the boundaries so it can be built in a six-week
time-box.</p>
<p>Then you distill that design into a pitch.</p>
<p>All of this happens in your own private sphere. You’re not sharing it
with the devs until the end.</p>
<h3 id="from-raw-idea-to-narrow-descriptions">From raw idea to narrow
descriptions</h3>
<p>When the raw idea is proposed, the default response should be
‘interesting. Maybe some day’. That’s it. Too early to say yes or
no.</p>
<p>Dig into it, figure out the underlying ‘whys’ of the request. Users
tend to ask for the swiss army knife they know when the problem they are
having requires one tool.</p>
<p>At this stage, you are defining the problem in words.</p>
<p>If it seems too big to be done in a 6 week time-box, chop bits off.
Use the time-box constraint to focus on what is important.</p>
<p>If it seems too <em>small</em> for a full 6 weeks of work, change the
time-box to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>When the problem is ‘narrow’, and you know what ‘done’ looks like,
you can start shaping solutions.</p>
<h3 id="from-descriptions-to-fat-marker-solution-sketches">From
descriptions to fat-marker solution sketches</h3>
<p>Sit on your own or with someone you trust, who understands how the
business works.</p>
<p>Create ‘breadboards’ - box-and-arrow diagrams with names of places
the user will go, ways they will interact with the places, and
connections (arrows) between the places</p>
<p><img src="../../images/shape_up_images/breadboard.png" /></p>
<p>Create ‘fat marker sketches’ of the UI - visual elements which convey
the idea of what is wanted, without any detail.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="fat-marker sketch" src="../../images/shape_up_images/fat_marker2.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">fat-marker sketch</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’re trying to get the <em>elements</em> of the design - ‘the user
will click a button to do xyz’. Or ‘the user will see a grid like
calendar for the next 2 months’</p>
<p>Be ruthless about eliminating nice-to-haves, and if you see
applications for a piece of functionality beyond the current use case,
make it explicit that this is outside the boundary of the current piece
of work. When you have eliminated nice-to-haves, never mention them to
anyone. If they’re out of scope, they’re out of scope.</p>
<h3 id="examine-the-design-for-implementation-time-bombs-and-tail-risk">Examine
the design for implementation time-bombs and tail-risk</h3>
<p>While your design will not include specific implementations (that’s
the devs job), you as designer need to know for each part of your design
that an implementation is plausible given the six week constraint.</p>
<p>In particular you want to avoid ‘tail risk’ for implementations -
things you ask for in the design that can <em>look</em> simple to
implement, but in reality can end up extending the shipping date by 2-3
times the 6 week window. Technical solutioning is a minefield of these
things.</p>
<p>This comes down to experience, technical sense and design sense;
knowing what is possible, knowing what sort of problem tends to lead to
these rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Walk through the design again, looking out for holes, and making sure
you at least have an idea of each piece could technically be
implemented.</p>
<p>Where you don’t have a clue, you need to loop in technical experts.
But be conscious, and emphasize to them that this is still <em>private
work</em>, the clay isn’t yet dry. Use whiteboards, not PowerPoints. Be
conspiratorial about it. Stick to what you already have, and ask their
opinion on how this could be implemented in a 6 week period. Don’t ask
them for design proposals on things you haven’t got a design for yet</p>
<h3 id="writing-the-pitch">Writing the pitch</h3>
<p>The pitch is what is presented to the people who decide what will be
worked on in the next cycle. Ahead of the meeting you need to prepare
the pitch.</p>
<p>Define the problem first, usually with a single, specific user story
that show why what you have now doesn’t work for you.</p>
<p>State the time-box you’ve set - whether you’re targeting a 2 or 6
week window - to constrain the conversation.</p>
<p>When outlining the solution, you want to be a bit more concrete and
tidy than fat marker sketches, but still at a pretty high level,
definitely not wire-frames. A version of the current UI that you’ve
drawn on to show your intent is good here. <em>Annotated</em> fat-marker
sketches are also OK. You should be looking at 2-6 sketches for the
solution, with a bit of blurb around it.</p>
<p>Explicitly call out things you will <em>not</em> be looking to
do.</p>
<p>Circulate it to people ahead of the pitch.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of pitches from the book.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Pitch Example 1" src="../../images/shape_up_images/pitch_ex_1.png" />

</figure>
<figure>
<img alt="Pitch Example 2" src="../../images/shape_up_images/pitch_ex_2.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pitch Example 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="step-2-choosing-from-among-pitches">Step 2: Choosing from among
pitches</h2>
<p>At the start of each cycle, during the cool-down, a group will get
together and pick what to work on in the next time-box from the list of
options pitched. People who are interested in pitching something will
have prepared and submitted a pitch.</p>
<p>There’s no centralized backlog or list of pitches. If people want an
idea to happen, they can come and pitch it. If they forget, don’t have
time or can’t be bothered, it’s clearly not so important. If the pitch
is rejected and is a good idea, it will come back.</p>
<p>Usually the group will be a few senior people, knowledgeable enough
to know what’s valuable to the business. It should be a couple of hours
max. Participants are expected to have studed the pitches, and talked
with people they think necessary to understand the proposal
beforehand.</p>
<p>The decisions at the meeting are the last word. There is no step 2
approval.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-building">Step 3: Building</h2>
<h3 id="handing-over-responsibility">Handing over responsibility</h3>
<p>No tickets, no task-master. Give the dev the pitch (which has the
explicit boundaries around what to build) and give them the
responsibility to implement the thing in the way they think is best. The
responsibility of the designer at this point switches to
manager/monitor.</p>
<p>The definition of done is <strong>deployed</strong>. So QA, testing,
needs to happen in the window.</p>
<p>The first few days is head-down, no-code. Devs are learning the lay
of the land, reading, thinking. Figuring out how to approach the
problem. Leave them to it, don’t worry if you don’t see much visible
output. If you don’t see anything after 3 days, though, it’s time to
check in.</p>
<p>Tasks are discovered, not planned. We discover what needs to be done
by doing work, often something unrelated. There should be no master plan
created by you or the devs, especially one where everything only comes
together in the middle of the sixth week.</p>
<p>Distinguish nice-to-haves from must-haves in some visible way.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h3>
<p>Focus on making something tangible, clickable, in the first week or
so. Think <em>vertical slices</em>, not horizontal ones. <em>integrate
early</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="integrate 1" src="../../images/shape_up_images/integrate1.png" /> <img alt="integrate 2" src="../../images/shape_up_images/integrate2.png" />
<img alt="integrate 3" src="../../images/shape_up_images/integrate3.png" /></p>
<p>Don’t worry about things being pixel perfect on the front end, about
all the fonts being right. The elements, buttons, etc. are the thing.
Style comes later.</p>
<p>Start with what is <em>core</em>. If your feature is to invite
clients into your environment and share certain documents with them,
start with the functionality that lets a client see (or not see) a
document. Peripheral aspects - logging in, renaming clients - can
wait.</p>
<p>Make the first thing <em>small</em>. You’re looking to build
something that can be clicked in a few days, to build momentum.</p>
<p>It should be <em>novel</em>, as in you haven’t done it before. If the
new thing you’re implementing has the same shape as another piece you’ve
done before, that’s not novel. The goal is to attack the parts with
highest uncertainty first, both to eliminate the uncertainty and for the
team to learn.</p>
<h3 id="grouping-tasks-into-scopes">Grouping tasks into scopes</h3>
<p>The above method of finishing vertical slices can be generalized and
used throughout the project. You want to separate the project into
vertical slices, not by what programmer A needs to do and what
programmer B needs to do.</p>
<p>The devs will start discovering tasks as they work. At this point the
tasks will be disjoint, without structure. As time goes on, we’ll learn
how the tasks relate to each other, and a structure will become visible,
and you can group the tasks into <em>scopes</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="scopes before" src="../../images/shape_up_images/scopes_before.png" /> <img alt="scopes after" src="../../images/shape_up_images/scopes_after.png" /></p>
<p>To emphasize, this is <em>not</em> done upfront. Scoping isn’t
planning. It happens in the process of doing work. You don’t need to
have every task in a scope at all times. They’re likely to come out
around week 2. They are not fixed, they can change. Read the <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.3-chapter-12#case-study-message-drafts">case
study: message drafts</a> for a worked example.</p>
<p>The size of scopes should be small enough that they can be completed
in a few days. Record it how you like, but you could think of each scope
as a todo list of tasks, with a special ‘unscoped’ list for anything
without a scope for now.</p>
<p>These scopes become the language of the project. They are the things
you talk about, when you talk about how to complete the project, and
where you are in it. “After Bucket Access is done we can implement
Invite Clients. Then we’ll Update Recording Visibility when people on
the firm flip the Visibility Toggle.”</p>
<h4 id="signs-that-youve-got-the-scopes-nailed">Signs that you’ve got
the scopes nailed</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>You feel like you can see the whole project .</li>
<li>You’re not worried something nasty is hidden down in the
details.</li>
<li>Conversations about the project become more flowing when you talk in
the language of scopes.</li>
<li>When new tasks come up, you know where to put them. The scopes act
like buckets that you can easily lob new tasks into.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="signs-youve-got-the-scopes-wrong">Signs you’ve got the scopes
wrong</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s not clear how ‘done’ a scope is. This is a sign the tasks in
the scope lack cohesion.</li>
<li>The name is generic, like ‘front-end’ or ‘bugs’. Avoid ‘grab bag’
scopes like that.</li>
<li>It would take more than a few days to implement. Break it up.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="measuring-progress">Measuring progress</h3>
<p>Managers shouldn’t have to ask for progress, they should be able to
see it.</p>
<p>Counting tasks on todo lists are not a good way to communicate
progress. Firstly, they aren’t complete. New tasks will always be
discovered. Todo lists grow as progress is made, so using completed
vs. uncompleted tasks as an indication of progress will always
overestimate how far along you are.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="todo" src="../../images/shape_up_images/todo.jpg" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">todo</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Time or effort estimates are better, but the problem is they are
point estimates, they don’t include uncertainty. Two tasks can both have
a 2 point estimate, but if the dev has done the first task ten times
before and never done the second, the uncertainty around the second is
<em>much</em> higher than the first. And we’re talking asymmetric, very
fat-tailed uncertainty here. The level of uncertainty dominates the mere
point estimate as a factor in measuring progress. So focus on that
instead.</p>
<h4 id="the-hill-metaphor">The hill metaphor</h4>
<p>Phase 1 of work is figuring out what to do. This is the uphill phase,
where you’re walking up the hill, and you can’t see the downward slope
on the other side of the peak. The peak of the hill is when you say ‘now
I know what to do’. From the peak you can look down see all the work
involved, and you start on the downhill phase of actually executing on
it</p>
<p>What do you know when you’re in the uphill phase? Not much. You know
you’re in phase 1. Since you can’t see the downhill side, you can’t see
how long it is. So ‘what percent complete is this thing’ is not an
answerable question. Giving estimates with any rigorous basis is not
possible. You can pretty much say where you are, relatively, on the
upward slope of the hill, before you hit the peak.</p>
<p>When you hit peak, and say ‘now I know what I need to do’, you can
give a decent estimate, since from the peak you can see the whole
downhill slope in front of you.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Hill" src="../../images/shape_up_images/hill1.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hill</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you are communicating where you are on a scope, plot where you
are on the hill.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Hill with scopes" src="../../images/shape_up_images/hill2.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hill with scopes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Read the example <img alt="here" src="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.4-chapter-13#work-is-like-a-hill" /> as far as ‘Status without asking’</p>
<p>The hill metaphor helps make visible when someone is stuck. It will
manifest as a dot on the uphill leg that isn’t moving.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to think you’ve reached the peak, think you’ve
identified what you need to do, and then find yourself backsliding
because you hadn’t actually solved it. You think “I’ll just use this API
library”, then when you try to implement it you find out it doesn’t do
what you thought it did.</p>
<p>The uphill portion is about <em>eliminating unknowns</em>. If you
have an idea for an approach, you need to validate that approach with
hands-on work. That’s still part of the uphill work.</p>
<p>Getting the work with the biggest unknowns to the top of the hill is
critical. You can leave it at the top and work on something else if you
have to, but if you have scope with a lot of unknowns (i.e. you’ve no
idea how to do it), make it a priority to get it to the top of the
hill.</p>
<h3 id="decide-when-to-stop">Decide when to stop</h3>
<p>Shipping means shipping something imperfect. You’re not going to get
every task done.</p>
<p>Always compare what is deployable to the <strong>baseline</strong> -
what is already in production, what customers already have. Don’t use
the mythical ‘perfect product’ as your point of comparison. “How much
better is what we have now to what is currently in production” is the
relevant question.</p>
<p>Scope always grows. Use the circuit breaker to drive trade-offs - you
have to ship at the end of the 6 weeks, and you won’t be working on this
thing after that. So what’s in and what’s out? <em>Hammer</em> your
scope ruthlessly.</p>
<h4 id="qa">QA</h4>
<p>Developers and designers are responsible for everything except edge
cases. QA are responsible only for edge cases, not for making sure the
product does what we expected it to do. Devs write their own tests to
handle any reasonably foreseeable circumstances</p>
<h3 id="move-on">Move on</h3>
<p>Shipping will generate new work. Customers will say “Now it does
this, it would be great if it also did this”. There will be bugs.
Customers are resistant to change, and will always push back on workflow
changes at first. Give it time to settle in.</p>
<p>Any change requests, feedback, just feeds back into the
shaping-pitching-building cycle, it doesn’t go out of band.</p>

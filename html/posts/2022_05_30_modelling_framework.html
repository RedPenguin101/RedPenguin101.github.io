<h1 id="reflections-on-a-modelling-framework">Reflections on a modelling
framework</h1>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks I’ve been working on a framework for
creating financial models of the type used in project
finance<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn1" id="note1" title="Footnote 1">1</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn1">
<a class="fnref" href="#note1" title="Footnote 1 Reference">1</a>
https://github.com/RedPenguin101/modelling-framework </span>.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll give the background to the domain, the motivation
for the framework, some examples, and reflections on how it has turned
out after a fortnight of intermittent work.</p>
<h2 id="financial-modelling-in-practice">Financial Modelling In
Practice</h2>
<p>Financial modelling is a widely used technique in finance to help
judge the advisability of potential investments or projects. It involves
the prediction of future cash flows and profits, based on a set of
inputs. It allows the users of the model to create different scenarios
by varying those inputs (“What if I spent less on capex?”)</p>
<p>The ubiquitous tool for creating financial models is the Excel
Spreadsheet. The use of Excel to create models is a foundational tool
for budding investment bankers, and many will spend their first few
years getting very good indeed at creating
them<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn2" id="note2" title="Footnote 2">2</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn2">
<a class="fnref" href="#note2" title="Footnote 2 Reference">2</a> There
is even a ‘Excel eSports’ scene. See for example the <a href="https://www.fmworldcup.com/">Financial Modelling World Cup</a>
</span>.</p>

<p>The layouts of these spreadsheets vary from person to person, but
they typically involve the following core elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A separate ‘Inputs’ or ‘Assumptions’ sheet, where the creator can
vary the inputs to the model.</li>
<li>Several ‘Time Series’ sheets. These consist of a set of measures
down the side or y-axis, and periods across the x-axis. These are at the
heart of the model.</li>
<li>An outputs sheet which summarizes the outcomes of the model that are
of interest to the user. For example, the Internal Rate of Return
(IRR).</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Time Series Sheet" src="../../images/2022_05_30_modelling_framework/spreadsheet_timeseries.png" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Time Series Sheet</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typically the modeller will be creating time series for elements like
operations, debt and equity, as well as the standard financial
statements of cash-flow, income, and balance sheet.</p>
<p>For an idea of the type of problem that is typical in this space, see
<a href="https://fmworldcup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Charging-Station-Task-Only.zip">the
Charging Station sample case</a> (note: zip file). The scenario
describes creating a model for a typical electric vehicle charging
station, involving the modelling of construction of the station, the
drawdown and repayment of a debt facility which finances the
construction, the sale of electricity based on assumptions about the
number of electric vehicles on the road, and a government subsidy. Note
that this is a highly simplified version of most ‘real world’ models,
meant as it is to be created quickly in a competitive setting.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-for-an-alternative-to-spreadsheets">Motivation for an
alternative to Spreadsheets</h2>
<p>In all honesty there is not much of a problem with using Excel for
creation of these models. It is broadly an excellent match of software
to need. I will talk about specific benefits of the Spreadsheet for
modelling when I compare it to what I built, but in general the
spreadsheet format provides flexibility, and the task-oriented formula
on the mostly numeric data-types
involved<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn3" id="note3" title="Footnote 3">3</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn3">
<a class="fnref" href="#note3" title="Footnote 3 Reference">3</a> Dates
also feature prominently. </span>
give substantial power. My motivation is largely out of curiosity.</p>

<p>There are a few problems that result from the use of spreadsheets,
particularly when models start to get large (&gt; 500 rows) and
<em>especially</em> when multiple people are required to interact with
them. Here are a few I can think of, in no particular order.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-version-control">Difficulty of version
control</h3>
<p>Excel models are notoriously difficult to version control. This is
difficult even in a single-user capacity - a typical solution will
involve ‘saving’ (copying) outputs of the model, then counting the
number of changes in those outputs as you change things. This is
definitely useful, but first it gives little visibility into
<em>why</em> things have changed, and second it doesn’t distinguish
between change caused by modification in inputs and changes in the model
itself, an important distinction.</p>
<p>Things get rather more bleak when it comes to VC over the longer term
and with multiple users. Really the only tools available are the file
system and file names, combined with any conventions you have
established. This leads to the infamous
<em>model_2022_05_04_14_12_version_2_final_3_reviewed.xlsx</em>
problem.</p>
<h3 id="reliance-on-vba-macros-for-advanced-functionality">Reliance on
VBA Macros for advanced functionality</h3>
<p>While Excel has a bunch of features that are useful for modelling,
there are many significant holes. These take the form of quality-of-life
shortcuts such as the ability to format cells without leaving the
keyboard, visualizations, advanced dependency tracing etc. These are
generally implemented as Excel Addins written in
VBA<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn4" id="note4" title="Footnote 4">4</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn4">
<a class="fnref" href="#note4" title="Footnote 4 Reference">4</a> <a href="https://macabacus.com/">Macabacus</a> is a popular example.
</span>.</p>

<p>The main problems with these are that they can be rather opaque, are
not very portable, tend to be quite coupled to a particular convention,
and the nature of the VBA implementation often means that important
features like ‘undo’ are disabled.</p>
<h3 id="above-a-certain-size-models-take-so-long-to-update-that-you-have-to-turn-off-automatic-recalculation">Above
a certain size, models take so long to update that you have to turn off
automatic recalculation</h3>
<p>Modellers tend to have automatic calculation turned off, and to get
into the habit of recalculating sheets and workbooks as they make
changes. This is not <em>only</em> because of the size, but it’s part of
it. However, if you forget, or if your model does something unexpected,
you can often be left scratching your head after you recalculate. Or, of
course, you can just forget to recalculate.</p>
<h3 id="difficulty-of-handling-circular-references">Difficulty of
handling circular references</h3>
<p>This is such a problem that a full quarter of the book <em>Corporate
and Project Finance
Modeling</em><sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn5" id="note5" title="Footnote 5">5</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn5">
<a class="fnref" href="#note5" title="Footnote 5 Reference">5</a>
https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/corporate-and-project/9781118854365/
</span>
is dedicated to it. From that book</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some elements of project finance analysis and modeling are among the
most difficult challenges in programming and cause continuing headaches
for modelers. The worst nightmares often result from circular logic,
resolution of which can sometimes make a model far less flexible for
structuring analysis and can make calculations very difficult to
trace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At base this is a problem of legibility: <em>Why</em> is the circular
logic occurring? In a complex model this can be <em>extremely</em> hard
to even comprehend, let along resolve, and Excel itself doesn’t give you
much in the way of tools to help you do this.</p>
<h3 id="lack-of-legibility-of-dependencies-on-larger-models">Lack of
legibility of dependencies on larger models</h3>
<p>This is possibly the most fundamental underlying issue with using
Excel for large models: the way the model is defined in Excel it can get
taxing to understand what is actually going on. Here are a few examples
of formula from a pedagogical model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>=IF( M12 = 1, 1 / ((1 + $F10) ^ (M11 - 1)), 0)</code></li>
<li><code>=IF(M20 = 1, INDEX($F15:$F18, M19), 0)</code></li>
<li><code>=$F29 / $F30 * M32 * $F31 * M33</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is quite evident - it’s impossible to understand what
this formula is doing without individually looking at the referenced
cells. The first could be written as:
<code>if in-operating-period, 1/(annual-degradation^contract-year-number), else 0</code>.
The last (with a couple of elisions) would be
<code>power-tariff * electricity-generation</code></p>
<p>Modellers have adopted several conventions for mitigating this
problem. First they keep formula very simple, with no nesting, instead
favoring additional rows with ‘intermediate’ calculations. Second, keep
formula references local, and where necessary have dedicated ‘import’
rows to bring in data from other sheets (note that none of the above
formula reference another sheet).</p>
<p>While these are obviously improvements, it does have the consequence
of adding a large amount of bloat to models, which has its own
legibility penalty. But more importantly it eases but doesn’t solve the
fundamental problem that, just by looking at a formula, you can’t tell
what it actually does, you have to look at each cell that is being
referenced.</p>
<h3 id="a-close-coupling-of-model-and-output">A close coupling of model
and output</h3>
<p>The above problem illustrates another: The ‘definition’ of a model is
sort of hidden in the output of the model, when in fact they are
separable. If you look at a model spreadsheet, where is the model
defined? It is in the time-series output, the formula that are copied
across the sheet.</p>
<p>In theory this provides flexibility: if you want a model row to have
one calculation from period a-b, but a different formula from b-c, you
can do that. An experienced modeller, however, will recoil in horror at
this suggestion: an inconsistent formula for a row would be nightmare to
debug.</p>
<p>This has the interesting outcome that you can theoretically totally
separate the definition of the model from its application to results.
This would mean you can build and examine the model separately.</p>
<p>That you are unable to do this in Excel, that model and application
are inextricably linked by nature of the Spreadsheet conception, harms
the legibility of the model, including by introducing the above
mentioned formula tracing problem.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-community-solves-these-problems">How the community
solves these problems</h3>
<p>The answer of the community to most of these problems has been the
establishment of convention. For example, the ‘coding’ of certain colors
of text to imply certain things, such as blue text meaning that a row
has been ‘imported’ from another sheet. The convention that formula
contain lots of white-space, or that sheet-imports are separated from
calculations.</p>
<p>This is not much of an answer though. In effect it means that to get
a good model you have to [a] be good at modelling [b] know all the
conventions, and [c] be extremely disciplined at applying those
conventions.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-building-a-model-in-the-framework">An example of
building a model in the framework</h2>
<p>The best way to introduce the framework is to build something in it.
Our first task is to model the ‘headers’ of the time series: the period
number, and the period start and end dates.</p>

<p>Next we get to the meat of the model: a <strong>calculation</strong>.
A calculation is made up of a group of related <strong>rows</strong> (in
the sense of rows on a spreadsheet), each of which have a definition of
how to generate a time series. A calculation has the following
elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A namespace - here “period”</li>
<li>A set of row-names - number, start-date etc.</li>
<li>A set of formula associated with the row-names, which are used to
“construct” the time series.</li>
</ol>
<p>The formula themselves are s-expressions - executable code - but in
addition to functions and variables you can also have
<em>references</em>. These are contained in square brackets, and can
reference other rows either inside or outside the calculation.
Referencing <code>[:start-date]</code> will pick up the value of the
start date row from the same period. <code>[:start-date :prev]</code>
will pick up the value from the <em>previous</em> period.</p>
<p>For example, the formula for the row <code>:number</code> (meaning
period number) is <code>(inc [:number :prev])</code>. That is, increment
the previous period number, to generate a time series
<code>[1 2 3 4 ...]</code>.</p>
<p><code>:first-period-flag</code> is a ‘flag’ (Boolean) which is ‘on’
if the period is the first period of the model. The formula
<code>(= 1 [:number])</code> should be evident, and generates the series
<code>[true false false ...]</code></p>
<p>The formula for start date is tricker:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure"><span id="cb4-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">if</span> [<span class="at">:first-period-flag</span>]</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a>  [<span class="at">:inputs/model-start-date</span>]</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a>  (add-days [<span class="at">:end-date</span> <span class="at">:prev</span>] <span class="dv">1</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In English this would be <em>“If it is the first period, take the
model start date from the inputs. Otherwise, add 1 day to the previous
period end-date”</em>.</p>
<pre><code>start-date:  2022-01-01     2022-04-01   2022-07-01
                ^                ^          ^
        taken from input        calculated from
        for first period        previous end-date</code></pre>
<p>A couple of things to note here: First, we use an if expression and
an <code>add-days</code> function in this formula, the latter of which
is defined as a utility function in the framework but could as easily be
a user defined function. This serves to illustrate that the user has the
full power of the host language available.</p>
<p>The second thing to note is that, till now, we have only seen
<em>local</em> references. That is, references to rows in the same
calculation (<code>:end-date</code> is another example from this
formula). In this formula we also see a reference
(<code>:inputs/model-start-date</code>) to a row in a <em>different</em>
calculation - here the <code>inputs</code>. Note that we have qualified
the reference with the name of the calculation.</p>
<p>The last lines of the program build the model and execute it,
printing the following table:</p>
<pre><code>|            :period/number | total |       1.00 |       2.00 |       3.00 |
|---------------------------+-------+------------+------------+------------|
| :period/first-period-flag |     0 |       true |      false |      false |
|        :period/start-date |     0 | 2020-01-01 | 2020-04-01 | 2020-04-01 |
|          :period/end-date |     0 | 2020-03-31 | 2020-03-31 | 2020-03-31 |</code></pre>
<p>That is, what we have created is the start date and end date measures
of a time. This simple pattern can be extended infinitely to create the
same complexity of models as you can in Excel.</p>
<p>A more complete (though still very simple) model can be seen <a href="https://github.com/RedPenguin101/modelling-framework/blob/main/src/models/power_up.clj">here</a>,
based on the FMWC “Power Up” sample case.</p>
<h2 id="a-conceptual-look-at-how-the-framework-works-in-building-up-and-running-models">A
conceptual look at how the framework works in building up and running
models</h2>
<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>
<p>We’ve seen above most of the key elements of the framework. A
<em>model</em> is a program which defines how to create a time series
‘period’ from a previous period. A model is built up by defining
<em>calculation blocks</em>. A calculation block consists of a name
(‘period’), and several <em>rows</em>. A row has a local name and a
<em>formula</em>. A formula is an expression which contains functions
and references to other rows.</p>
<p>A model is <em>compiled</em> by passing in the inputs, all the
calculations, and optionally metadata about the calculations. The model
is then run for a given number of periods to generate a <em>result</em>,
which can be printed.</p>
<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>
<p>The workflow that is intended to be idiomatic in the framework is as
important as the framework itself. Generally it’s expected that users
will use the framework something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The user will decide what thing they want to model - say, they
Revolving Credit Facility</li>
<li>They will set up a new, named but empty, calculation block</li>
<li>They will add that calculation block to the model compilation, and
set the block to print on save.</li>
<li>They will think about what needs to be added to the block, importing
rows from other blocks, and setting up placeholder rows.</li>
<li>They will iteratively build out the calculation block. Whenever they
make a change, they will save the file, which will evaluate the code and
print the results table with the changes they’ve made, giving a very
tight feedback loop</li>
<li>If they make changes to the block which violate the invariants of
the model (for example referencing non-existent rows, creating circular
dependencies) the compilation will fail and the user will be warned of
their mistake.</li>
<li>Once the user is happy with the outcome, they can tidy up the block,
clarifying names, etc.</li>
<li>After this they can commit the model changes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="reflections-which-of-the-problems-noted-above-are-solved-and-what-are-the-trade-offs">Reflections:
Which of the problems noted above are solved, and what are the
trade-offs?</h2>
<p>The main problem this framework is trying to solve is that of
<em>dependency legibility</em> generally, and the decoupling of the
model from the output specifically. The latter it does, by making the
model definition a completely standalone thing. The former is more
mixed, but positively it is easier to look at a calculation block and
see exactly how each row is calculated.</p>
<p>A side effect of this is that it is less necessary to ‘import’ rows
from other blocks, which Excel modellers need to do to avoid having
calculations to other blocks. By namespacing the blocks and row names,
this is much less necessary in the framework, because provenance is much
more clear. This would be a calculation block <em>with</em> only local
values in calculations, and then with embedded imports.</p>

<p>Which is preferred is ultimately a stylistic choice, but personally I
don’t find the latter any harder to read than the former.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the problem of version control is solved by virtue
of having the model defined in plain text. However all VC of
<em>results</em> is not part of the framework. The reliance on VBA is
obviously eliminated. Circularity is checked at compile time, and the
user has facility to examine a full dependency graph. Speed is (so far)
not a problem, though when the models start to get <em>very</em> large
I’m by no means sure that this will be faster. Even with smallish models
(~200 rows, ~200 periods) it can take a couple of hundred ms to run the
model. But we’ll have to see.</p>
<h3 id="shortfalls-and-trade-offs">Shortfalls and trade-offs</h3>
<p>When it comes to model legibility there are some trade-offs to be
made. But the big, honking hole in the framework is the legibility of
<em>results</em>. In short, for both modelling and examining results,
you really miss the rich formatting abilities of Excel, and just the
ability to see everything. Working locally is fine, but you really want
to be able to know what’s changed in your results set as a consequence
of your changes. You want to be able to mark things on the sheet, use
different colors, use different font sizes for headings etc. Excel is so
great at this, and it’s very hard to replicate. Ultimately the current
printing of results sets needs to be replaced with something that is
more flexible and more format-rich.</p>
<p>The actual syntax of model building is OK, but not fantastic. The
building of maps is a bit clunky. This could easily be fixed with a few
helpers. More difficult is some of the expression re-writing stuff. Take
this calculation definition, which dynamically adds contracts to a
contract revenue calc block depending on which ones are ‘on’ in the
inputs. The ability to do something like this is a significant benefit
over Excel, which struggles with this kind of dynamism (you would
effectively have to build a bunch of tables to do look-ups). However the
<code>(list '* [...])</code> stuff, which is building an expression the
model can evaluate, is pretty conceptually complicated programming -
effectively meta-programming - which is likely beyond the capabilities
of a user whose expertise is in <em>modelling</em>, not programming.</p>

<p>One thing I thought would be a big benefit, but turns out to be less
so, is the ability to use the full scope of the host language. In
reality, the vast majority of the rows use only a few functions -
conditionals, arithmetic, date functions. You just don’t really need
much more than that. Having a proper branching conditionals was helpful,
but that’s the only circumstance where I had to do something Excel
can’t.</p>
<h2 id="future-development">Future development</h2>
<p>Here are the things that will be crucial to getting this within a
country mile of MVP:</p>
<h4 id="a-new-front-end-for-displaying-results">A new front end for
displaying results</h4>
<p>This is the most critical thing. The printing of tables in the REPL
in plain text is not good enough.</p>
<h4 id="checks-and-warnings.">Checks and warnings.</h4>
<p>The user should have the ability to set up their own checks (e.g
balance sheet doesn’t balance), and on running the model they should be
warned if any of these checks are off.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-scenarios-and-goal-seek">Multiple scenarios and goal
seek</h4>
<p>The user should be able to run multiple scenarios based on different
input values and compare the outputs of those.</p>
<h4 id="version-control-of-results">Version control of results</h4>
<p>When the user runs the model, they should be able to see what has
changed from the last time they ran the model.</p>

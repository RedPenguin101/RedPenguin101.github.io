<h1 id="summary-anatomy-of-a-terminal-emulator">Summary: Anatomy of a
Terminal Emulator</h1>
<p>From the article <a href="https://poor.dev/terminal-anatomy/">Anatomy
of a Terminal Emulator</a> by Aram Drevekenin, which offers “a gentle
and broad introduction to the terminal emulator as a platform for
development.”</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal-the-psuedoterminal-and-the-shell">The Terminal, the
Psuedoterminal, and the Shell</h2>
<p>The terminal and shell are both executable programs. Modern examples
of the terminal are alacritty, kitty and gnome-terminal. Three examples
of shells are bash, zsh and fish.</p>
<p>The <strong>shell</strong> is a program which allows a user to
interface with the computer’s operating system. It can interpret
commands passed to it, and makes decisions about running other programs
and commands.</p>
<p>The <strong>terminal’s</strong> job is purely to display what the
shell tells it to.</p>
<p>The <strong>pseudoterminal</strong> (or PTY) forms a “bridge” between
the terminal and the shall. It consists of two channels, STDIN and
STDOUT. The terminal sends data to the STDIN channel, which the PTY
forwards to the shell. The shell sends output to the STDOUT channel,
which the PTY passes on to the terminal.</p>
<p>The PTY also <em>buffers</em> input from the terminal. That is, it
holds off on sending characters the user types into the shell until it
receives an <code>&lt;ENTER&gt;</code> character. Then it sends all the
buffered characters.</p>
<h2 id="ansi-escape-codes-the-language-of-the-terminal">ANSI Escape
Codes: The Language of the Terminal</h2>
<p>The shell can obviously send text to the terminal to display. However
it can also give it various commands about <em>how</em> to display those
characters, such as the color and style, and also <em>where</em> to
display, by commands which move the cursor around the screen.</p>
<p>The ‘language’ of these commands are “ANSI Escape Codes”. Here’s a
(slightly simplified) version of what the “fish” shell actually sends to
the terminal on starting up, and what some of these code mean. In short,
this sequence: Displays a welcome message; goes to a new line; sets the
cursor; and prints the time on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
<pre><code>^[(B^[[m\r^[[KWelcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell\r\n
^[]0;fish /home/aram^[[m^[[97m^[[46m⋊&gt;^[[m^[[33m ~^[[m^[[K^[[67C^[[38;2;85;85;85m10:21:15
^[[m\r^[[5C</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>^[(B</code>: change char set to ASCII</li>
<li><code>^[[m</code>: reset styles</li>
<li><code>\r</code>: cursor to line start</li>
<li><code>^[[K</code>: clear line after cursor</li>
<li><code>\r\n</code> cursor to next line start</li>
<li><code>^[]0;fish /home/aram</code>: Change terminal title</li>
<li><code>^[[97m</code>: Foreground bright white</li>
<li><code>^[[46m</code>: Background Cyan</li>
<li><code>^[[67C</code>: cursor fwd 67 chars</li>
</ul>
<p>This language can be used directly from the terminal, e.g
<code>echo -e &quot;I am some \033[38;5;9mred text!&quot;</code></p>
<h2 id="terminal-uis">Terminal UIs</h2>
<p>The above example sticks to the ASCII character set. There is also
the “special characters” character set (<code>^[(0</code>). This set
includes box drawing characters that can be used for drawing terminal
UIs. For example <code>echo -e &quot;\033(0lqqqk\nx   x\nmqqqj&quot;</code> draws
a box.</p>
<p>A key attribute of a modern UI is responsiveness - changing
dynamically in response to users resizing windows. You can do this in a
terminal UI by listing to the <code>SIGWINCH</code> signal, and using
the <code>ioctl</code> syscall to get the new size of the terminal.</p>
<h2 id="raw-mode">Raw mode</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where you want to show a
<code>Would you like to quit? [y/n]</code> message, and quit when the
user hits <code>y</code>. We saw above that the PTY buffers until you
hit enter, which you don’t want in this case: you just want the user to
hit “y” and exit the program.</p>
<p>You can accomplish this by putting the terminal into “raw mode”. This
does 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>STDIN is read char by char instead of buffering</li>
<li>Echo is disabled, so the terminal doesn’t print what you input</li>
<li>Special processing is disabled (e.g. Ctrl C will no longer send
SIGINT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Raw mode is used in many modern terminals because it allows much more
dynamism. For example, if you type an invalid command into a modern
terminal, it might ‘highlight’ it in red to indicate that it’s invalid
<em>as you type</em>. It can do this because your terminal is sending
data character by character.</p>
<h2 id="pty-as-a-file">PTY as a file</h2>
<p>Everything in Linux is a file, and the PTY is no exception. You can
run <code>ps</code> from your terminal and you might see something
like:</p>
<pre><code>   PID TTY          TIME CMD
 426886 pts/1    00:00:01 zsh
 427154 pts/1    00:00:00 ps</code></pre>
<p>The “TTY” here points to your PTY, which here would be the file
<code>/dev/pts/1</code>. So you can do
<code>echo &quot;Hi!&quot; &gt; /dev/pts/1</code> and your terminal will assume
that this is coming directly from the shell. You can also do
<code>echo &quot;Hi from new window!&quot; &gt; /dev/pts/1</code> from a
<em>different</em> terminal, and ‘hijack’ the terminal of someone else’s
process! This is one reason why you shouldn’t have multiple people
logging onto a production server as a single user.</p>

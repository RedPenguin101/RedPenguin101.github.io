<h1 id="modern-energy-grids-and-distributed-energy-resources">Modern
Energy Grids and Distributed Energy Resources</h1>
<p>Traditional energy utilities have coal, gas or oil burning power
plants generating huge amounts of electricity, which they connect to the
electric grid over long-distance wires to provide power to homes and
businesses. Their goal is (roughly) to match the amount of electricity
they are supplying to the grid to demand on it.</p>
<p>Power plants are still a fundemental part of the energy system. But
more recently things like solar panels and wind turbines have been added
to the mix. In addition to being greener than power plants, these tend
to be much individually <em>smaller</em> - usually less than 10kW of
energy, compared to thousands of times that for a traditional power
plant. These small sources of power are called “Distributed Energy
Resources”, or <strong>DERs</strong>.</p>
<p>This presents a new challenge for utilities: they don’t want to be
managing thousands of tiny energy producing units, where previously they
only had to worry about a few big plants.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to create a layer of abstraction
between the utilities and the physical DERs. This model allows utilities
to group several physical DERs together into a single, <strong>‘virtual’
DER</strong> for management purposes, sort of like a virtual power
plant, which the utility will deal with instead of having to worry about
the details of the underlying resources.</p>
<p>Once you have this abstraction you can do some pretty interesting
things. You can group different <em>types</em> of DER together into a
single virtual DER, shaping its output profile. You can group
geographically dispersed resources into a single resource. You can group
a set of DERs owned by a single provider into a single virtual DER to
act as an interface with that provider. You can group multiple
<em>virtual</em> DERs together into a ‘second level’ of
abstraction<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn1" id="note1" title="Footnote 1">1</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn1">

Interesting contrast/comparison with financial engineering here.

<p>Up to now we have considered DERs as things whose only purpose is to
produce power (turbines, solar panels), and we have set up a system for
being able to deal efficiently with a large volume of small DERs. This
opens an interesting possibility: we can extend the definition of a DER
to include anything that is connected to the grid to produce or store
power. This can include those who are traditionally the grid
<em>consumers</em> - businesses who have on-site generators or storage,
<em>individual homes</em> which have solar panels or batteries
(including batteries in EVs) installed.</p>
<p>Once these consumers are connected to the grid, you can take
<em>another</em> step and consider that, if the goal of utilities is to
balance demand and supply, then removing or rescheduling demand is
entirely equivalent to increasing supply. You come to the conclusion
that you can manage the grid by allowing those consumers you’ve
connected to the grid to add back capacity by reducing or rescheduling
their demand - A so called <strong>“Demand Response” DER.</strong></p>
<p>For example, a factory turning off a machine it’s running reduces
demand on the grid (generally called <strong>commercial and
industrial/C&amp;I demand response</strong>). Or an individual with an
EV could reschedule when their car is going to charge to a time when
there is excess grid capacity (a <strong>Residential DER</strong>).</p>
<p>So to summarize, our definition of a DER at this point is any small
producer, storer or consumer of electricity that has been signed up to
participate. The utility’s role is to manage the level of consumption or
production from those DERs to maintain a balance of supply and
demand.</p>
<p>What is needed is a system to manage this - a <strong>DERMS</strong>.
A DERMS can be used both by the utility itself to manage the DERs it
contracts with, or by the operators of the DERs themselves. For Demand
Response DERs (such as an individual with a house), these can be
programs which change the behaviour of energy controllers like
thermostats, EV charging stations or batteries in response to the grid’s
balance of supply and demand.</p>

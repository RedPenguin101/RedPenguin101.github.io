<h1 id="product-management-in-1000-words">Product Management in 1,000
Words</h1>
<p>The purpose of this post is to boil the topic down to its most
critical points. Much will be left out, and much will be simplified.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-right-thing">Building the right thing</h2>
<p>Ensuring your team is building the right thing is the core purpose of
the Product Manager. Everything else is secondary or in support of this
purpose.</p>
<h2 id="dual-track-discovery-and-build">Dual Track: Discovery and
Build</h2>
<p>The team’s ‘cycle’ of work has two phases: Discovery, where you
figure out what you should build, and Build, where you build it.</p>
<p>These phases should run on ‘dual tracks’. A PM should be running a
discovery cycle while the engineers are building, so you’re ready to
start the next build cycle.</p>
<h2 id="means-of-discovery">Means of Discovery</h2>
<p>Discovering what your users want is the main activity of the Product
Manager. You need to build empathy with your users.</p>
<p>The engineers rely on you to tell them what the customers want, what
is valuable to them, what they think, and how they will act. This is
difficult, because you have many users who think differently, and
because they themselves don’t know what they want.</p>
<p>You must be talking to a range of users, frequently, and in a range
of contexts. Some of these should be conversations, without specific
outcomes in mind. Some should be highly targeted, with specific
questions. <em>Write down what your learn.</em></p>
<p>Never take what users say at face value. Users know what their
problems are, but they are terrible at proposing solutions to their own
problems. If you build what users ask you to, you will build the wrong
thing. The hedge against this is to constantly <em>dig beneath</em> what
the users ask for. Ask why they want what they say they want. Ask it
many times in many different ways.</p>
<p>Talking to users is not scalable. Data is. Data shows what people
<em>do</em>, not what they <em>say</em> they’ll do. But you can easily
make incorrect assumptions about what data means. Treat any insights you
get from data as hypotheses, and find ways to test them.</p>
<h2 id="packaging-transitioning-from-discovery-to-build">Packaging:
Transitioning from Discovery to Build</h2>
<p>When you have a good sense of the user’s problems, you need to get
the work ready for the the engineers, by building a <em>package</em> (or
PRD, Pitch, Bet, Spec) for them. Whatever the implementation, keep in
mind the <em>goal</em> of the package is to familiarize the engineers
with the situation so that they can design something to solve the
problem. The package should have the following characteristics and
content.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It should be written down, to force exactness.</li>
<li>It should be readable in 5-10 minutes. This isn’t a contract, it’s a
tool for communicating, an excuse to have a conversation.</li>
<li>It should describe the current state and the problem from the user’s
perspective.</li>
<li>It should have clear success criteria and definition-of-done. This
provides structure, which will prevent later scope-creep and enable
delivery focus.</li>
<li>It should clearly state the <em>value</em> of solving the
problem.</li>
<li>It should <em>not</em> include solution or implementation. But it
should include things that constrain the design, including timing
constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p>The content also makes it useful for making prioritization decisions
between different problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-pm-in-build-phase">The PM in Build phase</h2>
<p>The relationship between PMs and Engineers has a huge impact on how
effectively your team will deliver value. There needs to be mutual
trust, respect, and credibility.</p>
<p>The goal of the PM in the build phase is to enable the engineers to
effectively build. This means getting them things that they need to do
that, and getting anything that <em>isn’t</em> that out of their
way.</p>
<h3 id="in-build-letting-developers-develop-providing-rapid-feedback-loops">In
Build: letting developers develop, providing rapid feedback loops</h3>
<p>Engineers build best when they can focus on a single thing for a full
day without interruption. Organizations create a lot of noise,
distraction and admin work. The PM must keep this noise away from the
developers, and not <em>contribute</em> to the noise by creating
unnecessary admin overhead.</p>
<p>The PM should create a frequent, usually daily, feedback loop so that
engineers can share what they’re doing, get feedback either from other
developers or the PM, and make quickly make course corrections.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-delivery-focus">Keeping delivery focus</h3>
<p>Software projects are inherently complex. They need to react to
changing circumstances and knowledge. Estimates will change constantly.
Responding to this apparent chaos with a tight structure is attractive,
but it will choke a project, inhibit delivery, and lead to engineers
feeling micromanaged and stifled.</p>
<p>However, letting the chaos reign invites scope-creep, rabbit holes,
and lack of coordination, all of which threaten delivery. The team needs
enough structure to keep engineers focused without inhibiting delivery.
The PM should provide this loose structure. It is a delicate balancing
act.</p>
<p>An engineer should always be clear what the definition of done is for
the task they are doing. If they don’t have this, they will spin. They
should always be aware of how that task they are doing connects to a
broader goal. This allows focus <em>within</em> the task, guiding
implementation, and allows the engineer to select their next task in a
decentralized but still coordinated way.</p>
<p>Make sure there are several ‘levels’ of goals, which can each provide
context for the levels on either side of it. Define clear cycles of
work, with defined outcomes. The cycle length, and how they are
implemented, depends on what works for the team and the situation. Start
with something, then iterate.</p>
<h2 id="product-feedback-transitioning-from-build-back-to-discovery">Product
Feedback: Transitioning from Build back to Discovery</h2>
<p>Every delivery is the start of a new discovery cycle. You need to be
ready to get feedback on what you delivered. What new user insights can
you get from what you’ve just delivered? How are you measuring how
effectively what you’ve delivered achieved meets the intended outcomes?
What do the users think of it? What are the <em>unanticipated</em>
outcomes? You should have a plan in place for establishing all of this
<em>before</em> you deliver the build.</p>

<h1 id="notes-while-reading">Notes while reading</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<ul>
<li>Power is a game, to be played</li>
<li>Dangerous to be overt. Seem fair and decent. The indirect route is better than the direct.</li>
<li>Balance of the aristocratic court. Serve, but don’t fawn, or face combinations against you</li>
<li>The supposed non-player. Professing weakness, demanding equality, naivete</li>
<li>The fundamental skill: master your emotions. Emotional response is the greatest barrier to power. Emotions cloud reason.Anger is the worst.</li>
<li>Power requires deception. It requires you wear masks. It requires the ability to take a certain distance from yourself.</li>
<li>What you do <em>not</em> do is as important as what you do. Learn to judge all things by what they cost you.</li>
<li>Power is social. It required you study and understand people. Recognize (hidden) motivations. Knowledge of motives is the lever. Study <em>everyone</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="law-1-never-outshine-the-master">Law 1: never outshine the master</h2>
<p>Make those above you feel comfortably superior. Please and impress them. But don’t shine too much, or you’ll be seen as a threat, especially if they are insecure. Make them appear more brilliant than they are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transgression: Fouquet and Louis XIV, the party</li>
<li>Observance: Galileo and the Medici’s, Jupiter</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I would say <em>find out how they would like to appear, and help them take on that appearance</em> would be a better description based on the stories. Louis wanted to be at the center of all. Fouquet’s party made him look flashier than the King. Galileo’s original patrons did <em>not</em> want to look like mere ‘providers of funds’, they wanted to have their names linked with cosmic forces (whether for vanity or practical purposes doesn’t matter).</p>
<p>Note2: This is evidently about how to be promoted into and stay in favor, with that favor bestowing power or benefits. It requires a master who has the power of patronage.</p>
<h3 id="a-dont-get-hubristic-when-you-are-in-favor">1a: Don’t get hubristic when you are in favor</h3>
<p>Never assume that, because you are the favorite, you can do what you like. Favorites fall all the time. But hubris is intoxicating.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transgression: Sen no Rikyu and the sandal statue</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-flatter-by-asking-for-help">1b: Flatter by asking for help</h3>
<p><em>Discreetly</em> flatter. Act Naive, make it seem like you need his expertise. Ask for advice and help, regardless of whether you need it. They will feel good about themselves dispensing their wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="c-make-your-ideas-look-like-a-consequence-of-their-advice.-publicly.">1c: Make your ideas look like a consequence of their advice. Publicly.</h3>
<h3 id="d-reversal-if-you-master-is-a-falling-star-reverse-all-of-this-advice.">1d (reversal): If you master is a falling star, reverse all of this advice.</h3>
<p>But be <em>very</em> careful.</p>
<h2 id="law-2-dont-trust-in-your-friends-use-your-enemies">Law 2: Don’t trust in your friends, use your enemies</h2>
<p>Friends will betray you quickly out of envy. Hire an enemy and he will be more loyal, because he has more to prove.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transgression: Emperor Micheal III and Basilius, and Bardas.</li>
<li>Observance: Chinese Emperor Sung, ending the cycles of former comrade generals being raised by the troops</li>
</ul>
<p>Friendship is not a basis for loyalty. Beneficence is not repaid with loyalty - in fact the opposite. The rewards are taken as ‘earned’, inflating their view of their own merits. The rewards are then seen as inadequate to the merits, resulting in resentment.</p>
<p>A friend expects more, and when they get it, they judge it by definition inadequate to their talents. An enemy expects nothing, so given them everything.</p>
<p>The friend is rarely the one who has the ability to help you most.</p>
<p>Talleyrand and Fouche: Bury the hatchet with enemies, put them in your service if you can.</p>
<h3 id="a-use-your-enemies-to-define-your-cause-and-your-own-positions">2a: Use your enemies to define your cause and your own positions</h3>
<p>Mao, the Japanese, the Strategy of Constant Conflict</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Be certain in the long term you will emerge victorious (What? How?)</li>
<li>If you have no apparent enemies, find one, even from a former friend</li>
<li>Use your enemies to define your cause more clearly to those you want to win over.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-dont-be-distressed-by-the-enemy-you-see-be-grateful-you-know-they-are-there.">2b: Don’t be distressed by the enemy you see, be grateful you know they are there.</h3>
<h3 id="c-reversal-use-friends-to-do-your-dirty-work">2c (Reversal): Use friends to do your dirty work</h3>
<p>Friends can be used to do dirty jobs, since they will be more willing to take a chance for you, and because they will make convenient scapegoats if it goes wrong.</p>
<h2 id="law-3-conceal-your-intentions">Law 3: Conceal your intentions</h2>
<p><em>Never</em> reveal the purposes behind your actions. This keeps people off balance, and doesn’t give them ammunition to work with or intelligence to counter your plans.</p>
<p>Most people blurt their opinions at every opportunity, and reveal their plans. Why? First, it is easier to do it than not. Second, they believe that honesty wins peoples hearts (It is not, people do not respect or fear those who are predictable and familiar).</p>
<p>Concealment is easy because people will always tend to believe that whatever you say your views are is honest. Constantly doubting everything you are told would be exhausting.</p>
<h3 id="a-use-red-herrings">3a: Use red herrings</h3>
<p>Use false sincerity, send ambiguous signals, set up misleading objects of desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transgression: Ninon de Lenclos and the art of seduction</li>
<li>Observance: Bismark, faking opposition to the Austrian war on basis of principle, rather than his real view that Prussia wasn’t ready for war yet.</li>
<li>Observance: Marlborough and the fort</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b-if-you-are-associated-with-a-viewpoint-renounce-it">3b: If you are associated with a viewpoint, renounce it</h3>
<p>People will usually believe that you’ve had a change of heart.</p>
<h3 id="c-hide-your-intentions-not-by-closing-up-but-constantly-talking-about-goals-other-than-your-true-ones">3c: Hide your intentions, not by closing up, but <em>constantly</em> talking about goals other than your true ones</h3>
<p>This means you will <em>appear</em> to be open and trusting, your true intentions are concealed, and your rivals will be mislead</p>
<h3 id="d-the-meta-concealment-you-must-constantly-talk-about-how-much-you-value-honesty-and-forthrightness.">3d: The meta-concealment: You must constantly talk about how much you value honesty and forthrightness.</h3>
<p>When actually you don’t. If you can sow the seeds that this is your view, you will appear sincere when spouting your other deceptions.</p>
<h3 id="e-use-bland-masks-to-disguise-your-actions">3e: Use bland masks to disguise your actions</h3>
<p>People can only focus on one thing at a time. Put a fake situation at the front as a mask, and conduct your true plan behind it.</p>
<p>The bland exterior - the poker face - is often best front. Hide behind the comfortable and the familiar, since people will be lulled by it. Extravagance is suspicious.</p>
<ul>
<li>Observance: Joseph Weil, the boxer, and the hunting lodge smokescreen</li>
<li>Observance: Haile Selassie and the warrior-chief Balcha</li>
</ul>
<p>The paranoid and wary are often easy to deceive. Winning their trust in one area blinds them to your true intentions in another.</p>
<p>The simplest smokescreen is your face. <em>Never</em> let your true reactions show. Bland smiles, nondescript look. Kissinger’s monotonous voice, blank look, recitation of detail. Don’t <em>act</em>, just hide.</p>
<p>The Pattern is another smokescreen. If you establish a pattern that you will act in a certain way, people will expect you to continue acting in that way.</p>
<h3 id="f-reversal-if-you-get-a-reputation-for-deception-own-up-to-it">3f (reversal): If you get a reputation for deception, own up to it</h3>
<p>If you practice deception a lot, eventually you will get a reputation for it. You can either play the “honest rogue” or the “repentant rogue”. You will both be admired for your frankness <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and will be able to continue practicing it without damaging yourself too much.</p>
<h3 id="g-reversal-occasionally-a-conspicuous-gesture-is-the-right-diversion.-but-dont-overdo-it">3g (reversal): Occasionally a conspicuous gesture <em>is</em> the right diversion. But don’t overdo it</h3>
<p>This is the showman approach, like the snakeoil salesman using an entertainment front to sell quack potions. But use it sparingly: the charlatans must move on to the next town often. Blandness is a better long-term bet.</p>
<h2 id="law-4-always-say-less-than-necessary">Law 4: Always say less than necessary</h2>
<p>The more words you say, the more commonplace you appear, and the less in control.</p>
<p>Make what you say vague, open-ended and sphinxlike. It will seem original even if banal.</p>
<p>Silence makes people uncomfortable and they will fill the silence with revealing comments. Short, cryptic answers will put them on the defensive. They will leave the meeting and ponder your words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transgression: Coriolanus and his awful speeches.</li>
<li>Observance: Louis XIV: “I shall see”.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The King [Louis XIV] maintains the most impenetrable secrecy about affairs of State. The ministers attend council meetings, but he confides his plans to them only when he has reflected at length upon them and has come to a definite decision…He never discusses State affairs except with his ministers in Council. When he speaks to courtiers he refers only to their respective prerogatives or duties. Even the most frivolous of his utterances has the air of being the pronouncement of an oracle [Primi Visconti]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impose taciturnity on yourself to keep others off-balance, to remain unpredictable, to protect your motives intentions and desires. If you don’t talk, the other person will fill the gap. You will learn about them, they won’t learn about you.</p>
<p>[I see how this applies in a situation like that of Louis, when you are interacting with subordinates, and they are submitting to you for judgment. But how does this apply when you want something, when you need to convince?]</p>
<p>Words cannot be taken back. Be especially careful with sarcasm.</p>
<h3 id="a-reversal-dont-use-this-tactic-with-superiors">4a (reversal): Don’t use this tactic with superiors</h3>
<p>Silence can arouse suspicion and insecurity (see last law, which uses talking as a screen to avoid suspicion). Vague statements can be misinterpreted to your detriment. Being the jester, talking to entertain and conceal, can be better here.</p>
<h2 id="law-5-guard-your-reputation-above-all-else">Law 5: Guard your reputation above all else</h2>
<p>Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Proactively defend it. Damage the reputation of rivals where you can,</p>
<ul>
<li>Observance: Chuko Liang on the wall.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-damage-the-reputation-of-your-rivals">5a: Damage the reputation of your rivals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Observance: Barnum and Peale, the museum, hypnosis</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have no reputation yourself, sow doubt. Insidious rumors. Even after refutation, suspicion remains. The best outcome is you will infuriate you opponents, and they will make mistakes in defending themselves. [Note: It wasn’t clear to me if Barnum did this <em>anonymously</em> or not. I would think that would be more effective]</p>
<p>When you have a reputation, slander is too risky because it could damage you. Use ridicule, mockery instead.</p>

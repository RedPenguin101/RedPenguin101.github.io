from a skim read</h2>
<h3 id="build-buy-die.-disruption-is-coming">Build, Buy, Die. Disruption
is coming</h3>
<p>Software has disrupted many industries. It will disrupt yours. Don’t
be myopic.</p>
<p>To stay alive you need good devs, but you need good
<em>management</em> of devs as well, from the executive / non tech side.
That’s really what this book is about: a handbook for execs about how
tech teams work, and how to work with them.</p>
<p>You want to set up software as a profit center, not a cost center. Be
able to get things in prod <em>fast</em>, so you can adapt fast.</p>
<p>Buying off the shelf is fine for back-office stuff. But
<em>never</em> for customer facing functions, or functions that you see
as a differentiator for your business.</p>
<p>First: One-size-fits-all really means it fits no-one. If you have to
change your process to fit the software, but your process is your
differentiator, that’s not going to work.</p>
<p>Second: You can’t differentiate yourself if you’re using the same
stuff as everyone else.</p>
<p>Third: off-the-shelf is anathema to quick feedback loops, quick
adaptability. You need those attributes to succeed. You can’t
incrementally on-board a vendor product (mostly)</p>
<p>Forth: Integrations get <em>very</em> hard when you’re trying to
stitch together multiple vendor products.</p>
<p>Buying off the shelf <em>services</em>, on the other hand is fine.
Things like Slack, Twillo, Zoom. You obviously don’t want to build that
stuff yourself. The “Third Great Era of Software” is about using service
components to build original systems: using Stripe for payments, AWS for
Infra etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The only things companies should build themselves are the things
that are core to their business”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-motivates-developers-and-how-to-hire-them">What motivates
developers, and how to hire them</h3>
<p>Devs like solving problems, being creative. The do <em>not</em> like
being handed a checklist of technical tasks to complete (or at least,
they become apathetic when they are). Happily, this also leads to the
best solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We just say to a team ‘Here’s the idea, here’s roughly where we want
to go or want to build. It’s your responsibility to take that and figure
that out.’ There’s a lot of agency here, a lot of autonomy. They decide
how they want to attack the problem… We could detail something out and
figure out there needs to be forty-two steps and then…give someone
forty-two tasks…but then you’re telling them, ‘Don’t use your brain,
just do what we tell you’” - Jason Fried</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not hard to make the case that your Co is more attractive than
the FANGs, even if you can’t compete on salary. Emphasize and give
examples of how you treat your devs like <em>people</em>, not resources.
Candidates want autonomy, mastery, purpose. So sell on that. Salary
(above a ‘fair’ level) are secondary. Small teams are usually
compelling, so sell on that.</p>
<p>Early hires are especially important: recruit a great leader and the
rest will follow.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-set-up-your-dev-teams">How to set up your dev teams</h3>
<p>Small teams, as autonomous as possible. Minimal collaboration
required (that is <em>fine</em>, it’s not a problem). Interfaces between
teams should be well defined, including the APIs between the software of
the teams.</p>
<p>The goal with small teams is to keep that startup energy even as you
grow. Divide them by mitosis when they get too big.</p>
<p>The division of teams should be around common customers, missions and
metrics.</p>
<p>Most importantly the teams should have <strong>total decision making
authority</strong>. If a manager can swoop in and veto, the team doesn’t
have decision making authority.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s natural for leaders to want to delegate upward. It’s a sanity
check on the decisions, but for hard decisions, it’s usually easier to
ask your boss to make the call. But doing so is escaping accountability,
which isn’t good for building a culture of empowered leaders…My goal is
to make the single-threaded leaders accountable, but help them answer
their own questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t create buffers between devs and customers: the more direct
exposure they have, the better software they can build.</p>
<h3 id="innovate-by-experiment-be-tolerant-of-small-failures">Innovate
by experiment, be tolerant of small failures</h3>
<p>You don’t know what the right thing to build is ahead of time. You
have to experiment, and then base your next moves off the results of
those experiments.</p>
<p>Experimentation, though, means accepting, even celebrating failure,
which is anathema to the culture of most organizations. You have to
change that.</p>
<p>You also have to learn how to create good experiments: you need to
know what <em>business</em> assumption (not technical assumption) you
are testing <em>before</em> you start it. And what potential results
from your experiment will prove or disprove that assumption. You
<em>have</em> to measure it, and write it down.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure-developer-happiness-productivity-safety">Infrastructure:
developer happiness, productivity, safety</h3>
<p>Good infrastructure is hard to see the value of, but it <em>is</em>
extremely valuable.</p>
<p>First, devs hate fighting their tools. If you have good infra around
deployments etc. that’s a selling point to potential hires.</p>
<p>Second, it speeds you up. The less time devs spend on their own
infra, the more they can spend on solving actual business problems.</p>
<p>Create an infra team as soon as you can.</p>

<ul>
<li>Foreword
<ul>
<li>Software revolution Disruption will come to your industry</li>
<li>Delusion that there is no connection between software and x (where x
is your business)</li>
<li>Understand what well-crafted software can make possible</li>
<li>Management is crucial to using devs well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intro: the billboard. What Twillo is. Marketed to <em>devs</em>.
Message to business people: you can’t be disconnected from tech. “Why
Software is Eating the World” (2011)
<ul>
<li>Companies succeed in digital xform by building, not by using
software</li>
<li>digi disrupt not just about devs, about collab between
functions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s the purpose of this book: the Ask Your Developer mindset is
designed to help businesspeople better understand and collaborate with
technical talent in order to achieve those shared goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>problems the book addresses
<ul>
<li>tech teams working hard but overlooking customer needs</li>
<li>frustrated at how slowly devs are delivering</li>
<li>competitors are delivering faster</li>
<li>Having trouble hiring talent (or talent is leaving)</li>
<li>Tech leader struggling to help business counterparts understand the
complexity of building great software</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why devs matter
<ul>
<li>“Amazon is not a retailer. We’re a software company”. The software
is the competitive advantage. It is the product.</li>
<li>Move from IT as a cost center (support business) to profit center
(part of the product).</li>
<li>“Build vs. Die”, not “Build vs. Buy”.</li>
<li>Speed matters: Getting from idea to prod <em>fast</em>. A skill of
digital natives, good devs. Adapt quickly, Darwinian</li>
<li>Software person: When faced with a problem: “how can software solve
this problem?”. See through the lens of software</li>
<li>Fundamental agility of software. infinite malleability. Quick
feedback loops: customer to code (cf hardware)</li>
<li>One size fits all software doesn’t fit anyone. Lowest common
denominator. Can’t differentiate. Have to change business to match
software, should be the other way round. Integrations get <em>very</em>
hard when managing multiple vendor products.</li>
<li>If you want to become a software builder, you need to start by
changing the mindset of the entire organization. Hiring devs, or
changing how devs work isn’t enough.</li>
<li>“These world class software builders are everywhere. Companies need
to find them and turn them loose. Make them feel like owners”.</li>
<li>New Software supply chain. Like Ford. Divide industry in areas of
expertise and specialize (in reusable chunks of code). AWS, Twillo,
Stripe. Component Software. Building Blocks. <em>Third Great Era of
Software</em>. (Second era, SAAS, Salesforce, AWS)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Problem: how to organize co into small teams when work is
intrinsically connected? Keep code with teams, expose via APIs with
small surface areas (microservices). How to measure effectiveness?
Ascribe a cost.</li>
<li>Microservices are pluggable. You can sell them.</li>
<li>Kutcher: “The only things companies should build themselves are the
things that are core to their business”. Don’t rebuild Slack. Does it
differentiate from competitors? Back end operations: Buy</li>
<li><strong>ANYTHING THAT IS CUSTOMER FACING, YOU SHOULD
BUILD</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>YOU CAN’T BUY DIFFERENTIATION, YOU CAN ONLY BUILD
IT</strong></li>
<li>Software people should decide what to build and what to buy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>What drives devs to do best work? How do you as a leader motivate
them?</li>
<li>“Building software is easy, but building the <em>right</em> thing is
hard”. Experimentation and close contact with customers.</li>
<li>Unlocking innovation is a cultural thing. and culture starts at the
top</li>
<li>“The relationship between business people and developers is not well
understood, but is critical to solving business problems with
technology”</li>
<li>“The key to getting business people and developers to work well
together is for the businesspeople to <em>share problems, not
solutions</em>”</li>
<li>“When he asked me to solve a problem, I became more engaged”</li>
<li>Code is creative. Devs are motivated by being allowed to create.
“…when they’re turned loose and allowed to dream and solve real-world
customer problems creatively”</li>
<li>Superficial stuff: free food, dress codes, ping pong. Forget about
it.</li>
<li>“[Software engineers are] problem solvers. They sit down and look at
a problem and then find the most efficient way to solve it”</li>
<li>Assign problems, not tasks</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“We just say to a team ‘Here’s the idea, here’s roughly where we want
to go or want to build. It’s your responsibility to take that and figure
that out.’ There’s a lot of agency here, a lot of autonomy. They decide
how they want to attack the problem… We could detail something out and
figure out there needs to be forty-two steps and then…give someont
forty-two tasks…but then you’re telling them, ‘Don’t use your brain,
just do what we tell you’” - Jason Fried</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Most software is just CRUD. The real difference in how long it takes
to solve a problem and how well its solved comes from the developer
understanding the problem.</li>
<li>Get your devs talking to customers/users early and often (about the
<em>problem</em>). Remove any barriers you can to this</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="experimentation-as-prerequisite-to-innovation">Experimentation
as prerequisite to innovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>people are afraid to fail</li>
<li>but tolerance for failure is the key to innovation</li>
<li>an org should encourage incremental development to get around this,
because it reduces the cost of failure.</li>
<li>A culture that is good at experimentation</li>
<li>Experiments running <em>in production</em>. AB testing etc.</li>
<li>Learn about your customers quickly</li>
<li>Build or Die: you can’t incrementally adopt a purchased product
(mostly)</li>
<li>Can’t know ahead of time what ideas are good.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>First, vet the idea…[for] two things 1. what assumptions about
customers, the problem, or the market are you making, and how will your
experiment prove or disprove those assumptions? 2. If you are wildly
successful, will it be a big outcome? Otherwise, why bother?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>only reasons for declining: opp is too small, or don’t know how to
measure</li>
<li>experiments must have experimental outcomes, <em>have</em> to
measure. <em>write it down</em></li>
<li>The hypothesis is a <em>business</em> hypothesis.</li>
<li>when to pull the plug. Engineers are generally going to give you
straight answers, ask them.</li>
<li>How to fail without failing customers:
<ul>
<li>Just ask them. If they say ‘no, I wouldn’t buy that’, that’s a
failed experiment</li>
<li>“Painted Door”: write some ads and put them on google, without
building the product, see if you get bites.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hiring-devs">Hiring devs</h3>
<ul>
<li>It’s not hard to make the case that your co is more attractive than
FANGS.</li>
<li>Have to be treated like people.</li>
<li>Early hires especially important</li>
<li>Recruit a great leader and the rest will follow</li>
<li>Don’t rush, don’t settle</li>
<li>real reasons for work (after ‘fair’ salary): Automony, Mastery,
purpose.</li>
<li>Recruiting: get CEO’s / Execs to swoop in as closers.</li>
<li>Make potential hires aware of your problems, get them excited about
solving them. Create a hero’s journey for them</li>
<li>Small teams approach is always compelling. Sell it if you have
it</li>
<li>Don’t pay bonuses :P. Bonuses are premised on cash motivating
performance. It’s not true, at least for engineers</li>
<li><strong>Ask your developers why you are having trouble hiring
developers</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-learning-environment">Open learning environment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open, learning environment. Continually seek truth</li>
<li>NOT classroom learning or book learning. Learning from eachother.
Feedback loops to improve.</li>
<li>Needs guardrails and support</li>
<li>Open project reviews: OPRs. Anyone is welcome to observe any project
meeting. Public calendars. Agenda published 2 days before. Only specific
people allowed to speak. Become a classroom</li>
<li>AWS Weekly business review</li>
<li>Tension between openness and safety</li>
<li>Blameless postmortem</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="small-teams-single-threaded-leaders">Small teams, single
threaded leaders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Startups have energy. How do you retain it? Small teams</li>
<li>2 pizza</li>
<li>Group teams around customer, mission, metrics</li>
<li>Divide teams by Mitosis, cell division</li>
<li>Teams should be empowered to make decisions independently. No
“cascading”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s natural for leaders to want to delegate upward. It’s a sanity
check on the decisions, but for hard decisions, it’s usually easier to
ask your boss to make the call. But doing so is escaping accountability,
which isn’t good for building a culture of empowered leaders…My goal is
to make the single-threaded leaders accountable, but help them answer
their own questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If there’s always a manager who can veto, the person who has the
decision actially doesn’t.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autonomous teams don’t need to work together much</li>
<li>Many mistake this for a problem. It’s not.</li>
<li>Where teams do need to collaborate, formalize the relationship with
‘service contracts’</li>
<li>Interfaces are usually APIs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wearing-customers-shoes">Wearing customers shoes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Eat your own dog food if you can</li>
<li>Don’t create buffers between devs and customers (sales, product
managers etc.)</li>
<li>Start from press release: focuses on what your customer wants, works
backwards.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agile-for-executives">Agile (for executives)</h3>
<ul>
<li>features, deadlines, quality, certainty: pick 3, maybe 2</li>
<li>Throwing more devs at a delayed project will delay it further.</li>
<li>Forget the formal methodologies, trainers, consultants.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="infra">Infra</h3>
<ul>
<li>Good infra is hard to see the value of. But it <em>is</em> extremely
valuable.</li>
<li>Engineers hate fighting their tools. Make it easy for them, that’s
motivating for them</li>
<li>Twillo infra principles
<ul>
<li>Paved path vs. offroad. Don’t ban things, make the things you want
people to use attractive</li>
<li>Self service: IAAS</li>
<li>Opt into complexity: Opinionated, but customizable, flow.</li>
<li>Prioritize</li>
<li>Composability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t worry about duplicating work.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Other companies, most notably Microsoft, have become obsessed with
stamping out duplication only to dicover that the “de-duplication”
effort eats up more resources than it saves. That’s because keeping an
eye out for duplication and/or spending time de-duplicating overlapping
products means creating a new layer of oversight, which slows everything
down.</p>

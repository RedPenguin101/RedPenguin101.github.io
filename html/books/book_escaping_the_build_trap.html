<li><strong>Product Owner</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Build trap</strong>: The temptation to focus on output
(e.g. number of features shipped), instead of output (Value delivered to
customers.) Products developed in this way will inevitably be bad,
containing features that their customers don’t want or use.</li>
<li><strong>Value exchange System</strong>: What is value? Customers
have problems, wants and needs. A product or service will fulfill them,
and the customer will pay for them. Products do not have inherent value.
What they do for the customer has value.</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: A vehicle of value. Delivered to
customers, they repeatedly deliver value without the producer having to
build something new every time. Excel, baby food, Tinder, the iPhone are
all products.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>: Also a vehicle of value, but deliver value
based on the servicer putting in continuous human effort. Design firm,
accounting firms etc.</li>
<li><strong>Project</strong>: A discrete scope of work with a particular
aim.</li>
<li><strong>Company Strategy</strong>: a deployable decision-making
framework, enabling action to achieve desired outcomes, comprised of the
<em>operational framework</em> and <em>strategic framework</em>

<h2 id="summary-of-ideas">Summary of Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-build-trap">What is the build trap?</h3>
<p>The Build Trap is the authors term for the common pattern in
technology teams of building the wrong thing, and so ending up with
products that no-one wants.</p>
<p>Her hypothesis is that the major cause of the build trap is that the
organization is focused on <em>outputs</em> - “we released 10 features”,
“we met our deadlines” - not <em>outcomes</em> - measuring the value
being given to the customer. The prerequisite for this is putting much
more emphasis on thinking in terms of the <em>product</em> being offered
instead of narrower focuses on projects and services.</p>
<p>This problem starts at the top: The organization as a whole should be
<em>product-led</em> - that is, optimizing for business outcomes. Every
change to a product should tie back to producing value to the
customer.</p>
<p>She claims this is a problem with the <em>product management</em>
function of the technology organization, and the solution is to set up
robust product management practices. There are four interconnected areas
which comprise these practices. Interconnected because, for example, if
the organization is not product-led, the PM function will not be
incentivized to create practices that focus on outcomes.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="the-company-and-the-strategy">The Company and the strategy</h3>
<p>Sorry in advance for corporate bullshit terms - not my fault.</p>
<h4 id="company-vision">Company Vision</h4>
<p>Your business has a
<em>vision</em><sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn10" id="note10" title="Footnote 10">10</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn10">
<a class="fnref" href="#note10" title="Footnote 10 Reference">10</a>
I’ve left out the distinction between vision and mission that’s in the
text, I don’t think it adds much </span>.
Why does the company exist? Where is it going based on that mission? You
want a vision to act as an anchor point which you can always fall back
on when you’re thinking about what you should do.</p>

<p>The vision should be short and clear. Not <em>too</em> broadly
focused. “Being the market leader in X” is too broad. There should be
something in there that narrows the scope a bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the
way for socially conscious businesses.</p>
<p>Becoming the best global entertainment distribution service,
licensing entertainment content around the world, creating markets that
are accessible to film makers, and helping content creators around the
world to find a global audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="strategic-intents">Strategic Intents</h4>
<p>From your company vision, you create <em>strategic intents</em>.
These are the current areas of focus to move your company towards the
vision. The time-scope is usually a year or two. You shouldn’t not have
too many of them: just a few key things.</p>
<p>The trap that the C-suite fall into, and that strategic intents are
trying to avoid, is going into your yearly planning cycle you are just
coming up with a laundry list of ideas for goals, features or desires.
The problem is not that the ideas are <em>bad</em>, it’s that they are
usually not aligned to any broader strategy, pushing the business in
particular direction. It’s just sort of aimless.</p>
<p>Strategic intents should be high level and business focused. They
should be stated at the level of new markets, new revenue streams, or
focusing on a particular area with an associated revenue goal.</p>
<p>Here are the two strategic intents for the example company in the
book, with associated goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expand into the enterprise business: Increase revenue from currently
$5 million a year to $60 million a year in three years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Double revenue growth from individual users: Increase revenue growth
from 15% YoY to 30% YoY from individual users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strategic intents can involve the whole business: product
development, marketing, content creation etc. Obviously we’re only
looking at the product development piece here.</p>
<p>So what to do with these strategic intents? This is where we get out
of the Company level and into the product level.</p>
<h3 id="the-product-and-product-management">The product and product
management</h3>
<p>A product is a vehicle for delivering value. You sell it (or rent it)
to the customer, and you collect the revenue from it. You also
<em>improve</em> the product over time, so it delivers more
value<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn11" id="note11" title="Footnote 11">11</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn11">
<a class="fnref" href="#note11" title="Footnote 11 Reference">11</a>
Note this is different from a <em>service</em>, which requires you to
put in time and effort for every ‘unit’ of value that’s delivered to the
customer. </span>.
Product management is this process of determining why, how and when to
improve the
product<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn12" id="note12" title="Footnote 12">12</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn12">
<a class="fnref" href="#note12" title="Footnote 12 Reference">12</a> If
your company has more than one product, then it is said to have a
<em>product portfolio</em>. This introduces a further layer in the
strategy-to-product journey, so we’ll ignore it for now and assume that
there’s a single product. </span>.</p>


<h4 id="product-initiatives">Product initiatives</h4>
<p>We left the company strategy process at the point where we’d got to
some <em>strategic intents</em>. These are business goals about
expanding into new markets or growing an existing revenue stream. For
example: <em>Increase revenue growth from 15% YoY to 30% YoY from
individual users.</em></p>
<p>Next we need to turn these into <em>product initiatives</em>. These
translate the challenge laid down by the strategic intent into
<em>problems</em> that we will solve with our product. <em>How</em> can
we reach the business goals by changing the product.</p>
<p>Notice that this the focus is on <em>problem</em> identification and
exploration, not on <em>solution</em> development - that comes later.
Premature solution fixation is one of the biggest traps to fall into in
this stage.</p>
<p>For example, there are 3 paths to increasing revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>acquire more individual users</li>
<li>retain existing users better</li>
<li>create new revenue streams from existing users</li>
</ul>
<p>The third is slightly different, but the first two we can dive into
exploration.</p>
<p>First we should look to verify and quantify: What is the conversion
rate? What is the retention rate? Then we have to figure out
<em>why</em> users are not converting, and why they are leaving. This is
where user feedback, talking to the users, starts to become critical.
This is where we start to find the problems.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-product-management-and-what-makes-a-good-product-manager">What
is product management, and what makes a good product manager?</h3>
<p>Part of being a Product Manager (PM) is being the <em>Product
Owner</em> - but only in a sense. They are responsible for the
<em>why</em>: determining and communicating why the product is being
built and the outcome it will produce. They are not responsible for the
<em>when</em>. They do not own (but do work with the team on) the
<em>what</em>. They don’t care much about the <em>how</em> of the
technical implementation.</p>
<p>They need to have a very deep understanding of the business and the
customer, so they can identify what is valuable, and see opportunities
to create value. They should talk to (and otherwise get feedback from)
the customer a <em>lot</em>. Empathy for the customer is the critical
attribute. Tech-literacy is a must, but tech-expertise is not.</p>
<p>They should not be a mini-dictator, lording it over the team; a
waiter, mindlessly communicating customer requests to developers; or a
pseudo project manager, taking ownership of the <em>when</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>why</em> is the <em>product vision</em>. The PM needs to have
the vision and to effectively communicate it. They need to determine
metrics and goals for the product. They need to be given the time and
space to do vision and research work.</p>

<h3 id="appendix-is-your-org-product-led-questions-for-a-pm">Appendix:
Is your org product-led? Questions for a PM</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who came up with the last feature or product idea you built?
Hopefully no-one will know. Or it will be ‘the team’</li>
<li>What was the last product you decided to kill? If no-one can
remember, that’s a bad sign. Probably:
<ul>
<li>Commitment to customers happens too early</li>
<li>Budgeting can’t budge</li>
<li>No pushback to management</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When’s the last time you talked with your customers? <em>Worst</em>
answer is “we’re not allowed to talk to customers”.<br />
</li>
<li>What is your goal? First, <em>have</em> one. Second, it should be
<em>outcome</em> centric, not <em>output</em> centric. i.e. focused on
the value added to the business, not on ‘did we ship on deadline’</li>
<li>What are you currently working on? Passion is the telling sign</li>
<li>What are your PMs like? Are they well respected? Lack of respect can
either be because they’re too strong (dictators) or too weak (beaten
down by stakeholders and managers).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-1-the-build-trap">Part 1: The build trap</h3>
<ul>
<li>The build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their
success by <em>outputs</em> rather than <em>outcomes</em>.</li>
<li>It’s when they focus more on shipping and developing features rather
than on the actual value those things produce.</li>
<li>get out of the build trap by setting themselves up to develop
intentional and robust product management practices.</li>
<li>Training PMs is not enough. They will slip into old habits if the
organization isn’t set up right - i.e. is not <em>product-led</em></li>
<li>Priority not aligned. Likely have too many priorities</li>
<li>“peanut buttering your strategy”. So many strategic initiatives
spread over very few people.</li>
<li>PMs should be pushing back, but org has to be set up for that kind
of feedback.</li>
<li>Wrong people in role - marketers and sales people are not PMs</li>
<li>This part: How the build trap emerges, signs to look out for</li>
<li>Misunderstand value. Should be <em>outcomes they want to
create</em>, not <em>the amount of stuff you produce</em>.</li>
<li>Customers have problems, wants, needs. Value is realized when these
are filled</li>
<li><em>Every</em> feature and initiative should result in outcome that
is tied back to business value.</li>
<li>Understanding value is hard. But you have to do it.</li>
<li>Orgs create their own constraints. Overly rigid processes.</li>
<li>Companies operate on <em>project</em> based dev cycle. Scoping work,
deadlines, milestones. Problem is, no way to align these with the
strategy. Projects are essential part of product development - but
thinking only in terms of projects is damaging</li>
<li><em>products</em> are vehicles of value. <em>Repeated</em> value
without more work from anyone in the org.</li>
<li><em>services</em> use human labor to deliver value. Value at the
cost of work</li>
<li>Many companies have a mixed value model.</li>
<li>Products need to be nurtured and grown</li>
<li><em>Product led</em> companies optimize for business outcomes, align
product strategy to these outcomes, prioritize projects that will best
meet them</li>

the known unknowns and of reducing the universe around the unknown

<li>Product managers identify features and products that will solve
customer problems while achieving business goals. They optimize the
Value Exchange System.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="part-2-the-role-of-the-pm">Part 2: the role of the PM</h3>
<ul>
<li>The product manager deeply understands both the business and the
customer to identify the right opportunities to produce value.</li>
<li>responsible for synthesizing multiple pieces of data, (analytics,
feedback, market research), determining in which direction the team
should move.</li>
<li>keep the team focused on the <em>why</em>—why are we building this
product, and what outcome will it produce?</li>
<li>The chief product officer is the cornerstone of the product team in
companies, helping to tie together the business outcomes to the roadmap
and to represent its impact to the board.</li>
<li>Companies need to create a standardized product management career
path</li>
<li>PM anti-Patterns
<ul>
<li>Mini-CEO: PMs don’t have authority over people. They are not people
managers. They need to <em>influence</em>, not command. Mini-CEOs are
tiny kings, think they’re the next Steve Jobs. They will fail quickly
because they don’t have the trust of the team.</li>
<li>The waiter: takes orders from stakeholders/customers/managers. No
goal, no vision. No decision making. This is the majority of PMs. Leads
to product death cycle (see below)</li>
<li>Former Project Manager: (though you need a little Project Management
skill to do the role). Projects Managers are responsible for
<em>when</em>, PMs are responsible for <em>why</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>A great PM works with a team to create the right product that
balances meeting business needs with solving user problems.</li>
<li>LOTS of understanding of the business, the market, vision and goal

<li>NOT in charge of the <em>what</em>, only the <em>why</em>. They work
<em>with</em> the team on the what. Really it’s the <em>team</em> that

<li>Figuring out what to build: strategic and experimental approach</li>
<li>Must be humble enough in their approach to learn and take into
account that they don’t know all of the answers.</li>
<li>Lone wolf mentality is death for a PM. The idea that they and they
alone are responsible for the success of the product. Breeds
arrogance.</li>
<li>not expert in either tech or marketing. Must be

<li>Start with <em>why</em> - don’t dive into solutioning too early</li>

<h3 id="part-3-strategy">Part 3: Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good strategy is not a plan; it’s a framework that helps you make
decisions.</li>
<li>Product strategy connects the vision and economic outcomes of the
company back to product portfolio, individual product initiatives, and
solution options for the teams.</li>
<li>Strategy creation is the process of determining the direction of the
company and developing the framework in which people make
decisions.</li>
<li>Strategies are created at each level and then deployed across the
organization.</li>
<li>Focus on the whole, them zoom in on the parts</li>
<li>Too often, people think of their product strategy as a document made
up of a stakeholder’s wish list of features and detailed information on
how those wishes should be accomplished. And they’re peppered with a ton
of buzzwords like platform or innovation.</li>
<li>Communicating the end state of a product is not a strategy (though
it’s not a bad thing to do - you need the vision of the end
result.)</li>
<li>Bungay: Strategy is a deployable decision-making framework, enabling
action to achieve desired outcomes, constrained by current capabilities,
coherently aligned to the existing context.</li>

<li>Creating a strategic framework</li>
<li>“I went to my peers in the leadership team and asked them what was
the most important thing we could do as a company. They all gave me
different answers. It’s pretty clear we’re not aligned on what our
strategy is or what we want to become as a company.”</li>
<li>company strategy, two parts:
<ul>
<li>operational framework, or how to keep the day-to-day activities of a
company moving</li>
<li>strategic framework, or how the company realizes the vision through
product and service development in the market. aligns the company’s
strategy and vision with the products that are developed by the
teams.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strategies are interconnecting stories told throughout the
organization that explain the objective and outcomes, tailored to a
specific time frame. We call this act of communicating and aligning
those narratives strategy deployment.</li>
<li>Strategy deployment is about setting the right level of goals and
objectives throughout the organization to narrow the playing field so
that teams can act.

<h3 id="part-5-the-product-led-organization">Part 5: The product led
organization</h3>
<ul>
<li>The product-led organization is characterized by a culture that
understands and organizes around outcomes over output</li>
<li>a company cadence that revolves around evaluating its strategy in
accordance to meeting outcomes.</li>
<li>people are rewarded for learning and achieving goals.</li>
<li>Management encourages product teams to get close to their customers,
and product management is seen as a critical function that furthers the
business.</li>
<li>If there is one main reason I have seen companies fail to make a
transition, it’s the lack of leadership buy-in to move to an
outcome-oriented company.</li>
<li>Visibility in organizations is absolutely key. The more leaders can
understand where teams are, the more they will step back and let the
teams execute. We need a cadence of communicating strategy that matches
our strategic framework.
<ul>
<li>Quarterly business reviews: discussing progress toward the strategic
intents and outcomes of a financial nature.</li>
<li>Product initiative reviews: for the product development side of the
house. review the progress of the options against the product
initiatives and adjust our strategy accordingly.</li>
<li>Monthly Release reviews: provide the opportunity for teams to show
off the hard work they have done and to talk about success metrics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Roadmaps: <em>not</em> a Gantt chart. you should view them as an
explanation of strategy and the current stage of your product.
<em>Living</em> roadmaps.

<li>The theme</li>
<li>Hypothesis</li>
<li>Goals and success metrics</li>
<li>Stage of development</li>
<li>Any important milestones</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Phases: Experiment, Alpha, Beta, Generally Available</li>
<li>Product operations/ Chief Of Staff: Collect Data; report on goals,
outcomes etc.; set up product analytics platform; standardize product
processes; organize and run meetings; organize</li>
<li>Rewards, Incentives.Y ou should be rewarding people for moving the
business forward—achieving outcomes, learning about your users, and
finding the right business opportunities.</li>
<li>Safety and learning: Fail small and early, encourage it.</li>
<li>Budgeting: Think like a VC, not a corporation (antipattern:
over-promise to get budget)</li>
<li>break out of budgeting once a year. Instead, allocate funds to the
product portfolio as a whole. use the product initiative reviews to
determine what should be funded, based on the amount of certainty toward
the outcomes.</li>
<li>Customer centricity: deeply understand your customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quotes">Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of it is due to having too many priorities. Everything is
number one on your project list. You are peanut-buttering your
strategy—meaning that you have so many strategic initiatives spread over
very few people. You can’t give one team a large objective and expect
them to hit major goals in a month. Those things take time and manpower.
You have to build up to them. - Page 5</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategy is a deployable decision-making framework, enabling action
to achieve desired outcomes, constrained by current capabilities,
coherently aligned to the existing context. - Page 62</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>What are the responsibilities of a product manager?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a PM is <em>not</em> a UX designer</li>
<li>interface with the business, tech and design depts. to harness their
collective knowledge</li>
<li>A PM doesn’t have much direct authority</li>
<li>A PM is primarily responsible for the <em>why</em> of the product,
the direction of it. They are involved in the <em>what</em> (workflows,
UX etc.) and <em>when</em>, but these are owned by the team as a whole.
They are barely at all involved in the <em>how</em> - that’s the devs
job.</li>
<li>They craft the product vision, communicate it, and champion it.</li>
<li>They break down the purpose of the product into known knowns
(facts), known unknowns (questions, which they seek to answer), unknown
knowns (intuition, which they seek to validate) and unknown unknowns
(discovery, which they put processes in place to facilitate)</li>
<li>They connect the dots, taking information from various sources and
sifting and analyzing it, and turning that into the product vision.</li>
<li>It comprises <em>product ownership</em> (in the Scrum definition),
of defining th backlog and creating user stories, grooming work in the
backlog, and checking completed work. But that doesn’t cover the whole
thing</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes a good product manager?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>talking to users</li>
<li>the ability to empathize with users, walk a mile in their
shoes.</li>
<li>the ability to persuade and influence the team and the company that
what is being built is the right thing.</li>
<li>not being too attached to your own ideas - your job is creating
value, not implementing your ideas. So…</li>
<li>listening to criticism of your ideas and creating a process for
iterating them into good ideas</li>
<li>validate your ideas by seeking out data. Evidence, not opinions</li>
<li>get problems, wants and needs from customers, not solutions.</li>
<li>They push back against managers and stakeholders when they present
solutions, asking <em>why</em>.</li>
<li>Have a deep understanding of the business: what its goals are, what
its strategy is, how their product relates to that strategy.</li>
<li>They are technically literate, but don’t have to be a tech
expert</li>
<li>They understand the market, but don’t have to be a market
expert.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes a <em>bad</em> product manager?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the mini dictator (don’t be an asshole to UX and devs)</li>
<li>the waiter, taking what stakeholders ask for at face value, allowing
the priority to be dictated by the most important person in the
room.</li>
<li>the reformed project manager, focusing on the <em>when</em>, not
they <em>why</em>.</li>
<li>A lone wold mentality - a feeling that they alone are responsible
for the success of the product, and that they have to come up with it
themselves without input from others.</li>
</ol>
<p>What makes a good product management function?</p>
<p>Why do companies fall into the build trap?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They don’t understand their customers wants, needs or problems, and
so they can’t measure value. Because some targets are required, they
create proxies that they <em>can</em> measure, but don’t represent
value: features shipped etc.</li>
<li>They face unthinking pressure to fast-follow competitors,
superficially copying their features without understanding whether those
features are valuable.</li>
<li>They over-promise during sales pitches, leading to one-off features
that were not worth the investment because they are not widely useful.
Where the strategy is driven by the contracts the company can get, the
company is a <em>sales led</em> organization.</li>
<li>the <em>product death cycle</em> They do not find out what their
customers problems are, they just ask them what features are missing and
build those features without validating them.</li>
</ol>

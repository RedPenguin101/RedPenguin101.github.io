<p>When selling a high-tech product, customer segments can be divided into cohorts, shaped like a bell curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovators (3+sd from mean, tiny proportion): Technologists. those who crave new tech for new tech’s sake, even if it doesn’t work well yet</li>
<li>Early adoptors (1-3sd, about 1/6): Non-technologists, but are willing to take a shot on a new technology and adapt to it.</li>
<li>Early majority (0-1sd, about 1/3): Those who are willing to adjust their behavior provided they can see practical benefits, and are able to get references</li>
<li>Late majority (0-1sd, about 1/3): Those who will adopt only if there is there is significant support.</li>
<li>Laggards (1+sd, about 1/6): Those who are anti-new technology</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument of the author is that this progression is not <em>smooth</em>, there are jumps between all the cohorts. Small ones for the most part.</p>
<p>The exception is the jump between early adopters and the early majority. This is more like a chasm, and is very hard to cross. The cause of the chasm is that the early majority is only willing to adopt new technology when they have solid references. But early adopters (who will be the only customer base at this point) are not valid referees in the eyes of the early majority. So you have a catch-22.</p>
<p>The reason this is so much of a problem is that your product probably isn’t very profitable while your only customer base is early adopters. You need to cross the chasm or die out.</p>
<p>Another reason is that expectation based on a smooth curve can kill a company. When customer numbers start spiking, investors expect exponential growth. When that doesn’t happen the company enters a death spiral. What is more likely is a fairly long period of low growth while the chasm is crossed (if it ever is).</p>
<p>This book is about how to cross the chasm.</p>

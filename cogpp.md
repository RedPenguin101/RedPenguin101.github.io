# The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint

In corporate and government bureacracies, the standard method for making a presentation is to talk about a list of point organized onto slides projected up on the wall. For many years, overhead projectors lit up transparencies, and slide projectors showed high-resolution 35mm slides. Now "slideware" computer programs for presentations are nearly everywhere. Early in the 21st century, several hundred million copies of Microsoft were turning our trillions of slides each year.

Alas, slideware often reduces the analytical quality of presentations. In particular, the popular PowerPoint templates (ready-made designs) usually weaken the verbal and spacial reasoning, and almost always corrupt statistical analysis. What is the problem with PowerPoint? And how can we improve our presentations?

When Louis Gerstner became president of IBM, he encountered a big company caught up in ritualistic slideware-style presentations:

> One of the first meetings I asked for was a briefing on the state of the [main-frame computer] business. I remember at least two things about that first meeting with Nick Donofrio, who was then running the System/39O business. One is that I ... experiences a repeat of my first day on the job. Once again, I dfound myself lacking a badge to open the doors at the complext, which housed the staffs of all IBM's major product groups, and nobody there knew who I was. I finally persuaded a kind soul to let me in, found Nick, and we got started. Sort of.
>
> At that time, the standard format of any important IBM meeing was a presentation using overhead projectors and graphics that IBMers called "foils" [projected transparencies]. Nick was on his second foil when I stepped to the table and, as politely as I could in front of his team, switched off the projector. After a long moment of awkward silence, I simply said, "Let's just talk about your business"
>
> I mention this episode because it had an unintended, but terribly powerful ripple effect. By that afternoon an e-mail about my hitting the Off button on the overhead projector was crisscrossing the world. Talk about consternation! It was as if the President of the United States had banned the use of English at White House meetings.[^1]

## The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</h2>
Gerstner's idea, _"Let's just talk about your business,"_ means an exchange of information, an interplay betwee speaker and audience. Yet PowerPoint is entirely _presenter-oriented_, and _not content-oriented, not audience-oriented._The claims of PP marketing are addressed to speakers: "A cure for the presentation jitters." "Get yourself organized." "Use the AutoContent Wizard to figure out what you want to say."_ The fans of PowerPoint are presenters, rarely audience members

Slideware helps speakers to outline their talks, to retrueve and show diverse visual materials, and to communicate slides in talks, printed reports, and internet. And also to replace serious analysis with chartjunk, over-produced layouts, cheerleader logotypes and branding, and corny clip art. That is, PowerPointPhluff.[^2]

PP convenience for the speaker can be costly to both content and audience. These costs results from the _cognitive style characteristicx of the standard default PP presentation:_ forshortening of evidence and thought, lower spatial resolution, a deeply hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content, breaking up narrative and data into slides and minimal fragments, rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis, conspicious decoration and Phruff, a preoccupation with format not content, an attitude of commercialism that turns everything into a sales pitch.[^3]

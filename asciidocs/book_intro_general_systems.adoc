== Laws and principles

* *The law of medium Numbers*: For medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly. 
* *The main article of general systems faith*: That the order of the empirical world itself has an order which might be called order of the second degree
* *Composition law*: The whole is more than the sum of it's parts
* *Decomposition law*: The part is more than a fraction of the whole
* *The banana principle*: Heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop
* *The principle of indifference*: Laws should not depend on a particular choice of notation
* *Principle of difference*: Laws should not depend on a particular choice of symbols, but they usually do
* *The Eye-Brain law*: To a certain extent, mental power can compensate for observational weakness.
* *The Brain-Eye law*: To a certain extent, observational power can compensate for mental weakness.
* *The General Thermodynamic law*: More probably states are more likely to be observed than less probable states, unless specific constraints exist to keep them from occurring.
* *The Lump Law*: If we want to learn anything, we mustn't try to learn everything.
* *The General Law of Complementarity*: Any two points of view are complementary
* *The Axiom of Experience*: The future will be like the past, because, in the past, the future was like the past. Ot, Two things are alike if one in the present can be substituted for one in the past
* *The Invariance Principle*: With respect to any given property, there are those transformation that preserve is and those that do not preserve it. Or, With respect to a given transformation, there are those properties that are preserved by it and those that are not. Or, We understand change only by observing what remains invariant, and permanence only by what is transformed.
* *The Perfect Systems Law*: True systems properties cannot be investigated
* *The Strong Connection Law*: Systems, on the average, are more tightly connected than the average. Or, A system is a collection of parts, no one of which can be changed. Or, In systems, all other things are rarely equal
* *The picture principle*: When speaking about a dimensional reduction, insert the words "a picture of" in whatever you were about to say.
* *The Synchronic Principle*: If two systems occupy the same position in the state space at the same time, then the space is under-dimensioned, that is, the view is incomplete.
* *The Count to Three Principle*: If you cannot think of three ways of abusing a tool, you do not understand how to use it.
* *The first law of simpledynamics*: Endigitry cannot be created nor destroyed
* *The second law of simpledynamics*: Eventropy can never decrease
* *The Principle of Indeterminability*: We cannot with certainty attribute observed constraint either to system or environment
* *The Systems Triumverate*
.. Why do I see what I see?
.. Why do things stay the same?
.. Why do things change?
* *The law of effect*: Small changes in structure usually lead to small changes in behaviour. Or, Small changes in behaviour will usually be found to result from small changes in Structure.
* *The used car law*: A system that is doing a good job of regulation need not adapt. Or, A system may adapt in order to simplify its job of regulating.

== Chapter 1: The problem

A confession of ignorance.

Science has been successful - but also full of failure. When things get too complex, science struggles. The method of observation and experiment produces bad results. The General Systems Approach is born out sciences failures in these situations, by generalizing the ideas of observation and experiment in a wider context.

We consider the number of objects involved in a system as a rough measure of simplicity-complexity. Fewer objects make a system simpler. More, more complex.

=== Machines, Analytical Treatment, Organized Simplicity

We start with mechanical systems - machines. These are simple, in the sense they have few identifiable parts: 2, 10, maybe 30 for a complex one. Any more than that, and the equations aren't solvable. These formal methods, then, are limited. We can either simplify, and reduce the number of parts involved, or we can look outside formal methods to informal ones.

For example, the Solar System contains thousands of bodies, but when computing the gravitational effect these bodies have on each other using the Newtonian method, we must ignore nearly all of them. In this case, things work rather well. But it assumes a correlation between size and significance, which doesn't hold more generally - consider the tiny pineal gland in the brain.

Further, the Newtonian method requires that you can isolate and model parts of the system, then combine the isolated results. You can study bodies A and B, A and C, and B and C. Then when extending the model to all three bodies, the system can be composed from the pairwise models. Contrast that to a psychologist studying a family of 3: It's not possible to predict the behavior of the father, mother and child when they are together by studying how the father and mother act when together.    

The square law of computation states that, unless simplifications can be made, the amount of computation increases at least as fast as the square of the number of equations.  

How do we know a problem is a soluble in the space of mechanics? Because when we try the simplified model, the results broadly match the observational data. But note that these observations are from outside the mechanical system. Mechanics by itself doesn't tell us which systems are mechanical.

=== Aggregates, Statistical Treatment, Unorganized Complexity, Law of Large-Numbers

Reducing the number of objects of interest and how they interact is one method of dealing with complexity. Another is to deal with the average properties objects, rather than the exact properties of individual objects - to deal with _aggregates_. Consider the study of air molecules in a container. There are 10^23 molecules, but given their homogeneity, it isn't possible to ignore some of them as 'insignificant', nor to study 10 molecules in isolation. Instead, science in this area deals with average behavior of the molecules, relying on the fact that the large number of them will make the average behavior representative on the whole. This is the statistical approach.

What is the scope of the statistical approach? A requirement is that the population is large, and that behavior is sufficiently random. Randomness is the property that makes statistical calculations come out right.

=== Machines, Aggregates, Systems

Consider an attempt to model infection rates in a flu epidemic. If our population is large, and approximately randomly distributed (say, in a city), the analytical approach will likely not be possible, but the statistical one will. In the countryside, by contrast, the population is small, but is not randomly distributed - instead it's clustered in pockets. Any attempt to model using aggregates is therefore bound to fail.

We can consider the general case here: systems with low randomness and low complexity (number of objects) can be treated by the analytical approach, and those with high randomness and (by the law of large numbers) high complexity can be treated with the statistical approach.

This leaves us wth a significant gap: the region of medium to high complexity and low to medium randomness: Organized Complexity. Too complex for analysis and too organized for statistics. This is the area that systems thinking targets.

=== The Law of Medium Numbers

*For medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly.* Or, *Anything that can happen, will happen.*

Medium number systems are pervasive, but they are the systems we are least able to cope with using the tool of science. (This is not sciences _fault_ - only the user can be blamed for the application of an unsuitable tool).

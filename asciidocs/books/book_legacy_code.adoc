== In Outline

* The mechanics of change
** 1. Changing Software
*** Four reasons to change
**** Adding features, fixing bugs
**** Improving design
**** Optimization
**** Putting it all together
*** Risky change
** 2. Working with Feedback
*** What is unit testing?
*** Higher level testing
*** Test Coverings
*** The Legacy Code Change Algorithm
**** Identify change points
**** Find test points
**** Break Dependencies
**** Write tests
**** Make changes and refactor
** 3. Sensing and Separation
*** Faking collaborators
**** Fake objects
**** The two sides of a fake object
**** Fakes Distilled
**** Mock objects
** 4. The Seam Model
*** A huge sheet of text
*** Seam Types
**** Preprocessing seams
**** Link Seams
**** Object Seams
** 5. Tools
*** Automated Refactor Tools
**** Tests and automated refactoring
*** Mock Objects
*** Unit-testing harnesses
*** General test harnesses
* Changing Software
** 6. I don't have time
*** Sprout Method
*** Sprout Class
**** Advantages and Disadvantages
*** Wrap method
**** Advantages and Disadvantages
*** Wrap Class
** 7. It takes forever to make a change
*** Understanding
*** Lag time
*** Breaking deps
**** Build deps
** 8. How do I add a feature?
*** TDD
*** Programming by difference
**** Liskov Substitution Principle
** 9. I can't get this class into a test harness
*** The irritating parameter
**** Test vs. production code
**** Null objects pattern
*** Hidden deps
*** Construction blob
*** Horrible Include Dependencies
*** Onion Parameter
*** Aliased Parameter
** 10. I can't run this method in a test harness
*** Hidden method
*** "Helpful" language feature
*** Undetectable side effect
**** Command Query Separation
** 11. I need to make a change. What methods should I test?
*** Reasoning about effects
*** Reasoning Forward
*** Effect propagation
*** Learning from effect analysis
*** Simplifying effect sketches
**** Effects and encapsulation
** 12. I need to make many changes. Do I have to break all dependencies?
*** Interception Points
**** The simple case
**** Higher level interception points
*** Judging design with pinch points
**** using effect sketches to find hidden classes
*** Pinch point traps
** 13. I don't know what tests to write
*** Characterization tests
**** The method use rule
*** Characterizing classes
*** Targeted testing
*** A heuristic for writing characterization tests
** 14. Deps are killing me
** 15. My app is all API calls
** 16. I don't understand the code well enough
*** Notes/sketching
*** Listing Markup
**** Separating responsibilities
**** Understanding method structure
**** Extract methods
**** Understanding the effects of a change
*** Scratch refactoring
*** Delete unused code
** 17. My app has no structure
*** Naked CRC (Class, Responsibility, Collaborations cards)
*** Conversation scrutiny
** 18. My test code is in the way
*** Class naming conventions
*** Test Location
** 19. My project is not OO. How do I make safe changes?
*** An easy case
*** A hard case
*** Adding new behavior
*** Taking advantage of OO
*** It's all OO
** 20. This class is already too big
*** Seeing Responsibilities
**** Group Methods
**** Look at hidden methods
**** Look for decisions that can change
**** Look for internal relationships
**** Look for the primary responsibility
**** Interface Segregation Principle
**** Do scratch refactoring
**** Focus on current work
*** Other techniques
*** Moving forward
**** Strategy
**** Tactics
**** After extract class
** 21. I'm making the same changes all over the place
*** First steps
**** Deciding where to start
**** Abbreviations
**** Open/Closed
** 22. I need to change a monster method and I can't test it.
*** Varieties of monster
**** Bulleted methods
**** Snarled methods
*** Tackling monsters with automated refactoring
*** Manual refactoring challenge
**** Introducing sensing variable
**** Extract what you know
**** Gleaning deps
**** Break out a method object
*** Strategy
**** Skeletonize methods
**** Find Sequences
**** Extract to current class first
**** Extract small pieces
**** Be prepared to Redo
** 23. How do I know I'm not breaking anything?
*** Hyperaware editing
*** Single Goal editing
*** Preserve Signatures
*** Lean on the compiler
**** Pair programming
** 24. We feel overwhelmed
* Dependency Breaking Techniques
** Adapt parameter
** Breaking out method object
** Definition completion
** Encapsulate global references
** Expose static method
** Extract and override call
** Extract and override factory method
** Extract implementer
** Extract interface
** Introduce instance delegator
** Introduce static setter
** Link substitution
** Parameterize constructor
** Parameterize method
** Primitivize parameter
** Pull Up Feature
** Push down dependency
** Replace function with function pointer
** Replace global ref with getter
** Subclass and override method
** Supercede instance variable
** Template redefinition
** Text redefinition
** (Appendix) Extract method

== Terms

* Legacy code
* Unit test
* Test Harness
* Coverage
* *Seam*: A seam is a place where you can alter behavior in your program without editing in that place.
* *Enabling Point*: Every seam has an enabling point, a place where you can make the decision to use one behavior or another.
* *Refactoring*. A change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its existing behavior.
* *Sensing*
* *Separation*

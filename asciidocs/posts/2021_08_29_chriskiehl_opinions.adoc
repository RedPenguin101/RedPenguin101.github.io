= Chris Kiehl's opinions

Literally just a copy of https://chriskiehl.com/article/thoughts-after-6-years[this list], with some of the points removed and a bit of rewording.

== Things I now believe, which past me would've squabbled with:

* Typed is better for a team with a range of experience levels
* Standups are useful for keeping an eye on the newbies.
* Retros when you need course correction, not for ceremony
* Design! A bad abstraction or missing layer will kill you.  
* Clarity over cleverness.
* Bad code can be written in any paradigm. FP is just a tool
* "Best practices" are context dependent
* Make it scalable when you need to scale  
* Static analysis is useful
* DRY only to avoid a specific problem.
* RDBMS > NoSql

Opinions I've picked up along the way

* YAGNI, SOLID, DRY. In that order.
* Pens are the best programming tools
* Practicality over purity is usually good
* Adding technology is usually bad
* Talking directly to the customer is the best way to understand the problem
* most 'engineering' decisions are made with no analysis, data, or numbers
* nearly all project managers are either ineffectual or reduce efficiency.
* interviewing is not a good way to judge candidates.

Old opinions unchanged:

* code style, linting rules obsessives are not helping
* coverage does not imply quality
* Monoliths are good in most circumstances
* TDD purists are just the worst.

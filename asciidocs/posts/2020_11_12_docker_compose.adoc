= Docker Compose

== Overview

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

3 Steps

. define app env with Dockerfile
. define services with _docker-compose.yaml_
. run `docker-compose up`

You can manage app lifecycles:

* start, stop, rebuild services
* view status of services
* stream log outputs
* run commands on services

Sample docker-compose file:

[source, yaml]
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
      - logvolume01:/var/log
    links:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: redis
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
----

== Install

Install docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[here]

== Example app

set up a folder `composetest`

set up a `requirement.txt` with flask and redis

set up a file `app.py`

[source,python]
----
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
----

create a dockerfile

[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
----

define services in `docker-compose.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
----

`docker-compose up`

Go to http://localhost:5000/

In another terminal, do `docker image ls`

Inspect with `docker inspect <tag or id>`

Teardown with `docker-compose down`, or ctrl+c in running process

== Putting in ENV var and dynamic code loading (bind mounts)

[source,yaml]
----
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes: 
      - .:/code
    # mounts current directory to /code inside the container, so you can 
    # change code on the fly
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
    # tells Flask to run in dev mode and reload on change
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
----

`docker-compose up`

Now you have the mount you can change the source file and it'll be rebuilt

== Other commands

`docker-compose ps` to see current running processes

`docker-compose run web env` to see env vars for web service

`docker-compose stop` shuts down and removes containers

`docker-compose down --volumes` does the same but also removes the redis data volume

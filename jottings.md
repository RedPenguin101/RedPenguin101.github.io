## Something about prescriptive approaches

> Beware overly prescriptive approaches to anything in this industry. Don't trust the word of some blog over what is best for your current team and circumstances.

The model is not the territory. The theory is the model, treat it like one

In theory there is no etc. etc. Yoga Berri

All laws, all x-driven-development

TDD especially. That beardy guy talk, but 100 others which 'dial back' the rigidity. Martin's attempts to live in the model.

Scrum, most Agile stuff.

What to do? How to act?

## Writing
Communication, meeting of minds. Information/idea exchange.

Types
* quick communications, emails, slack. "I want you to do this."
* Essays, explanatory. Ideas, rationales for actions. "This is what's in my head."

Quick comms
* Miller's law: nobody reads anything.
* Law is proportional to the apparent length of the message. The longer it is, the less likely it will be read. This is probably the opposite of what you intend if you write a long message.
* People won't read these, at best they will skim them
* Never ask for more than one thing in one message. You don't have to have everything in one go.
* Be much more explicit than you think you need to be.
* Have a point that can be expressed in a short sentence. That thing should stand alone and be the thing the eye is drawn to when looking at the message.
* If you have to explain, separate the point, the conclusion, the question, from the explanation. But probably don't explain.

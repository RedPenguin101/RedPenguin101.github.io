## 2 hour read (11:45-

### Part 1:

* Foreword
  * Software revolution Disruption will come to your industry
  * Delusion that there is no connection between software and x (where x is your business)
  * Understand what well-crafted software can make possible
  * Management is crucial to using devs well
* Intro: the billboard. What Twillo is. Marketed to _devs_. Message to business people: you can't be disconnected from tech. "Why Software is Eating the World" (2011)
  * Companies succeed in digital xform by building, not by using software
  * digi disrupt not just about devs, about collab between functions

> That's the purpose of this book: the Ask Your Developer mindset is designed to help businesspeople better understand and collaborate with technical talent in order to achieve those shared goals.

* problems the book addresses
  * tech teams working hard but overlooking customer needs
  * frustrated at how slowly devs are delivering
  * competitors are delivering faster
  * Having trouble hiring talent (or talent is leaving)
  * Tech leader struggling to help business counterparts understand the complexity of building great software

* Why devs matter
  * "Amazon is not a retailer. We're a software company". The software is the competitive advantage. It is the product.
  * Move from IT as a cost center (support business) to profit center (part of the product).
  * "Build vs. Die", not "Build vs. Buy".
  * Speed matters: Getting from idea to prod _fast_. A skill of digital natives, good devs. Adapt quickly, Darwinian
  * Software person: When faced with a problem: "how can software solve this problem?". See through the lens of software
  * Fundamental agility of software. infinite malleability. Quick feedback loops: customer to code (cf hardware)
  * One size fits all software doesn't fit anyone. Lowest common denominator. Can't differentiate. Have to change business to match software, should be the other way round. Integrations get _very_ hard when managing multiple vendor products.
  * If you want to become a software builder, you need to start by changing the mindset of the entire organization. Hiring devs, or changing how devs work isn't enough.
  * "These world class software builders are everywhere. Companies need to find them and turn them loose. Make them feel like owners".
  * New Software supply chain. Like Ford. Divide industry in areas of expertise and specialize (in reusable chunks of code). AWS, Twillo, Stripe. Component Software. Building Blocks. _Third Great Era of Software_. (Second era, SAAS, Salesforce, AWS)
* Problem: how to organize co into small teams when work is intrinsically connected? Keep code with teams, expose via APIs with small surface areas (microservices). How to measure effectiveness? Ascribe a cost.
* Microservices are pluggable. You can sell them.
* Kutcher: "The only things companies should build themselves are the things that are core to their business". Don't rebuild Slack. Does it differentiate from competitors? Back end operations: Buy
* **ANYTHING THAT IS CUSTOMER FACING, YOU SHOULD BUILD**.
* **YOU CAN'T BUY DIFFERENTIATION, YOU CAN ONLY BUILD IT**
* Software people should decide what to build and what to buy

### Part 2

* What drives devs to do best work? How do you as a leader motivate them?
* "Building software is easy, but building the _right_ thing is hard". Experimentation and close contact with customers.
* Unlocking innovation is a cultural thing. and culture starts at the top
* "The relationship between business people and developers is not well understood, but is critical to solving business problems with technology"
* "The key to getting business people and developers to work well together is for the businesspeople to _share problems, not solutions_" 
* "When he asked me to solve a problem, I became more engaged"
* Code is creative. Devs are motivated by being allowed to create. "...when they're turned loose and allowed to dream and solve real-world customer problems creatively"
* Superficial stuff: free food, dress codes, ping pong. Forget about it.
* "[Software engineers are] problem solvers. They sit down and look at a problem and then find the most efficient way to solve it"
* Assign problems, not tasks

> "We just say to a team 'Here's the idea, here's roughly where we want to go or want to build. It's your responsibility to take that and figure that out.' There's a lot of agency here, a lot of autonomy. They decide how they want to attack the problem... We could detail something out and figure out there needs to be forty-two steps and then...give someont forty-two tasks...but then you're telling them, 'Don't use your brain, just do what we tell you'" - Jason Fried

* Most software is just CRUD. The real difference in how long it takes to solve a problem and how well its solved comes from the developer understanding the problem.
* Get your devs talking to customers/users early and often (about the _problem_). Remove any barriers you can to this

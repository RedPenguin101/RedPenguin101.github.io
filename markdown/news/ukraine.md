# 28th February: The woes of the Russian army. Will it lead to a bloodier war?

Though Russian forces are 25km from Kyiv, have broken through in the South towards Odessa, and are advancing north, the war machine is struggling. Are those temporary problems? What will the consequences be?

The main problem is logistics and engineering. Many bridges have been blown, and Russia has not been able to get bridging units forward. Many vehicles are abandoned by the side of the road, either from breakdown or out of fuel, suggesting supply lines are overstretched.

Nor has Russia established air superiority. Ukraine's air defenses haven't been taken out by missile strikes as many expected. Air strikes have been light, though Su-34s have started appearing. Lack of CAS means troops are not properly supported, and Ukraine has been allowed to keep up Turkish made TB2 drones which are proving more effective than expected.

All this implies tactical shortfalls, and a lack of coordination between branches. Possible Russia is struggling with scale. There are over 100 Battalion Tactical Groups in the field, compared to around 12 deployed during the Crimea crisis. Supporting elements are spread thin. There are also signs of poor morale, with soldiers confused about whether Ukrainians are brother Slavs or 'drug addled Nazis' - both messages have come from the Kremlin. The number of young conscripts is high.

What does the slow progress presage? Russia certainly has the numbers on its side. Around a quarter of the forces deployed are uncommitted. The Kremlin has started to send in Wagner Group soldiers. To this point Russia seems to have worked hard to avoid civilian casualties. This might start to change. Already there is evidence of cluster bombs being used on residential areas in Kharkiv, and Su-34s have started to appear.

# February 26th: What does Putin want and where will he stop? What should the West do?
[Leader](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/02/26/history-will-judge-vladimir-putin-harshly-for-his-war), [Briefing](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/02/26/russias-invasion-of-ukraine)

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24th, after amassing 190k troops on the boarder. Contrary to what some thought, the war aim seems to be control over the entire area of Ukraine, not just Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia has attacked from the East, from Belarus in the North, and from Crimea in the South.

Putin would like the West to believe he will stop at nothing. He has alluded to using nukes if the West intervenes. If he succeeds in Ukraine he will not stop. He might not attack his NATO neighbours directly, but he will subject them to cyber and informational war. Putin believes that NATO is an existential threat to Russia, and is expanding Eastwards.

The world must inflict a heavy price. Massive sanctions against the financial system and moneyed elite. These can be effective: the Russian stock market has already fallen 45%.

NATO's Eastern flank must be reinforced. It should deploy its 40k rapid reaction force to frontline states to emphasise that, in seeking to undermine NATO, Putin is strengthening it.

# February 26th: Economic consequences of war in Ukraine

Russia is the worlds 11th largest economy. Severe sanctions look imminent. What are the consequences?

## Commodities
Commodities will be hit especially hard, by both physical disruption of infrastructure and sanctions.

Russia is a major exporter of gas, oil, industrial metals, potash and wheat (as is Ukraine). Prices of these, already rising, will rise further. Brent breached $100 per barrel (steadily increasing from a low of $70 in November) and European gas prices rose 30% on the 24th.

Commodity sanctions seem to have a seriousness they didn't before. None of the US oil majors pulled out after Crimea. It now looks more likely they will [Shell and BP have both pulled out of deals with Gazprom and Rosneft respectively on the 27th/28th Feb]. Germany (somewhat symbolically) mothballed Nord Stream 2 on 22nd February.

## Finance and tech sanctions
Tech and global finance are the other impact. In these areas, the economic power is much more on the side of the West. It's likely that Huawei-style sanctions will be imposed, limiting access to semiconductors, which will have long-term impact on the Russian economy.

Bank restrictions are also likely, possibly including cutting off Russian banks from SWIFT. Banking restrictions will bite immediately.

This will not be a surprise, and Russia has taken steps to insulate itself. It has built up foreign exchange reserves and reduced the share of dollar-denominated invoices. It will turn increasingly to China, and has already reduced the amount of dollar payments of Chinese trade from 97% to 33%.

The blowback on the West might be limited - exposure of Western banks to Russia is low. But this is the first time a major economy has been cut off, so there aren't any precedents to rely on here.

## The global economy
The shock to Russia will be serious but not fatal. Central banks will face tough decisions about how to handle inflation. Investment might decrease in the face of uncertainty.

Longer term, deglobalization will accelerate. The division of the world into blocs of east and west will continue as Russia is forced to pivot to China. The assumption of globalists that you should trade with everyone, not just your allies, will be challenged more strongly.

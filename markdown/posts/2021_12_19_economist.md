# Economist: 18th December

## US: Internal Migrations

The internet and remote work are changing where people want to live. The last time a change on this scale happened was suburbanization in the 50's.

There are two trends: moving from major urban areas to less dense cities and suburbs. And moving to warm, low tax states in the south.

For the first, 600k people moved from big to mid-sized cities, and 740k to rural areas and towns. Cost and covid are only two of the reasons. Crime, homelessness and business closures are high in cities, and progressive initiatives are increasing taxes.

Costs in the new places are increasing as a result, some by nearly 50% year on year.

Not all small town has benefited from the trend: places that were losing jobs before the pandemic generally haven't attracted many new residents.

Suburbs today tend to have more amenities, and to be more ethnically diverse than they were historically.

The second trend is a move southwards. The biggest have been Texas, Florida and Arizona (86% of the total), which have seen in-migration rates increase 46%, 24% and 16% respectively since covid. Florida and Texas have no state income tax (California has a 13% top rate, NJ has 11%). These states also tend to have been less harsh on covid measures.

## US: Kentucky Tornado

On 10th December, Mayfield Kentucky was hit by the worst US tornado in a decade. Can it recover?

Having a plan matters. An organized local government can petition for state and federal support. But smaller towns like Mayfield often don't have this expertise, or the ability to disperse the aid if they get it.

Poor towns have it harder: If you are not insured, or a renter, you will be less likely to get help. And consequently, more likely to leave.

## US: War on Christmas

Fox news has been talking about a war on Chrismas for two decades. After a homeless man set a Christmas tree on fire in NYC, Fox portrayed it as evidence that there was a war, and it dominated its coverage for a few days. Its CEO made a statement about it.

The war on Christmas is non-existent. Christmas is alive and well even as church attendance collapses (50% over 15 years). 9 of 10 Americans celebrate it. Fox's aim is commercial and political.

Attacks on Christmas have occurred, but from _Christians_. The puritans of Plymouth were against it on the basis that it is heathen and wasteful (the former is true: Christmas is a mish-mash of pagan and Christian beliefs that first took form in the 4th Century). Christmas did not start to become an official holiday until the mid 19th Century. It was an occasion of _popular_ celebration (and much drunkenness), though, which was slowly domesticated by the middle class. The modern gift-giving version of Santa comes from this domestication. The adoption of the Christmas tree in the same period was part of the same drive.

## North Korea: A decade of KJU

Kim Jong Un took over NK on December 17th, 2011. Today, NK is looking more isolated than it has in decades. Its border closure is among the world's strictest. There are reports of food shortages and political purges, even as diplomatic outreaches by the US and SK are rejected. Kim himself has admitted the food situation is "tense".

For the first few years, it did seem as though Kim might be a relative reformer, with visible improvements in living standards. Some private ownership was permitted, and experts from outside the country were invited to advise. A lot of tourist infrastructure was built in Pyongyang and elsewhere. Trade with China was stepped up. 

However, this now seems to have been a political necessity to build legitimacy and ensure the regimes continuation. More recently, repression has been increasing. Penalties for smuggling and watching foreign shows have increased. 

Foreign antagonism has also stepped up. The nuclear and ICBM programs have been resumed, causing economic sanctions from the rich world. The country's cyber warfare capabilities are strong and frequently used to raise cash through ransomware and theft.

Kim's diplomatic outreaches in 2017-2018 were an attempt to have these removed, but they fell flat. He has had more success with China, with steadily increasing imports (though not exports). Since covid, even these have flat-lined.

For now, though, the situation looks survivable, and it looks unlikely that Kim will come back to the negotiating table any time soon.

## Asia: Democratic Decline

The coup in Myanmar in Feb 2021 means it joins Thailand as the second coup-led military dictatorship in SE Asia. The region also includes Laos and Vietnam (Leninist dictatorships), Brunei (absolute monarchy), Cambodia (near-dictatorship) and Singapore (authoritarian one party-ish state). Its nominal democracies do not seem healthy. Duterte in the Philippines has attacked the press and judiciary. Jokowi in Indonesia was once hoped to be a straight-shooting reformer, but is not. Malaysia's reform movement now looks a lot like its predecessor. Sri Lanka, India, Afghanistan, all seem to be trending downwards.

There is still some glimmers of hope. India has reasserted democracy before, after Gandhi's short dictatorship of the 70's. For all Jokowi's failings, Indonesia's future elections are likely to be fair. The youth in these countries are angry and active.

## China and Lithuania

Lithuania withdrew its diplomats (temporarily, it says) from China on the 15th. This is the latest action in the saga that began with Lithuania allowing a "Taiwanese Representative Office" in its capital, for which China has been pressuring it ever since. China sent home the Lithuanian ambassador in September, downgraded its embassy in November, and told its staff to leave in December.

China asserts that America is behind Lithuania's actions. This is not totally unreasonable: Trump-era officials were not shy about urging allies to defy China. But Lithuania counters that it has a long history of standing up to larger bullying neighbours, including Germany, the Soviets and China itself.

As well as diplomatic pressure, there has been quiet economic action taken. Importers have been unable to list Lithuania as the country of origin for goods for weeks, making such imports as there are (not much) impossible. Other countries have been warned that there will be restrictions on goods with Lithuanian components.

Lithuania's move was not fully welcomed by its EU neighbours. Some though it needlessly provocative (China doesn't object to "Taipei" overseas offices). China's reaction, using economic and diplomatic coercion which politicians see as "breaking the rules", has hardened attitudes. It is not isolated: similar tactics have been used against Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea. China's bet that EU countries will choose the Chinese market over the Baltics looks ill-advised. France and even Hungary have spoken out. The EU has announced retaliation rules against economic coercion.

## Ethiopian civil war

Federal troops are pushing back up the road to Tigray, rolling back the rebel advance through Amhara between Tigray and Addis. It is another swing of the pendulum in the civil war, after rebels had got within 160km of the capital. The government has also largely pushed east, regaining control over the road to Djibouti and the sea.

This doesn't signal an end to the war. Tigrayans will be hard to beat in Tigray itself, and even if they are they have retreated to the mountains before.

The clock is ticking for the TLPF though. The blockade of their region by the government has been successful, with very little food getting through.

President Abiy's call to arms seems to have worked too, especially after he said that he would lead the fight himself. The army, no match for the hardened Tigrayans 6 months ago, is finding its feet after being bolstered by militias, and after upgrading its arms with drones.

Foreign intervention is a risk. Iran and the UAE are backing the government (their own antagonism notwithstanding), but the TLPF might try to drag in Sudan or Egypt on its side, both of which have beef with Ethiopia over a dam on the Nile.

## Libya's election

Libya's first presidential election is scheduled for the 24th. It's been messy, and will likely be postponed.

Libya has been chaotic since Qaddafi's overthrow in 2011. A disputed election in 2014 divided the country in two, when the ruling Islamists refused to give up power. In 2019, the East under Haftar put Tripoli to siege for 14 months. It failed, and a ceasefire and unified interim government followed in early 2021. The presidential election was meant to cap the process.

Even if it goes ahead, it might not change anything. Qaddafi's son Seif is running despite an indictment from the ICC for torture and murder, and might be popular amongst those too young to remember life under his father, and those craving its relative stability.

Haftar himself is also a candidate, and also accused of war crimes. He may do well in the east.

Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the interim PM, is a leading candidate in the West, after breaking his promise not to run. He sounds liberal compared to the other two, but that is not difficult.

## Denmark and Immigration

Denmark has a policy of breaking up "parallel societies": groupings of poor, jobless, uneducated people of common foreign origin. It also tries to prevent the formation of such pockets by carefully assigning housing to immigrants. 

Even further, it tries to deter migrants from arriving. In March it announced it would send Syrians back to Syria, arguing Damascus is now safe. It has an explicit "zero asylum-seekers" policy. In contrast to its neighbour Sweden, which "cherishes multiculturalism", the word is viewed negatively in Denmark. In many places anti-immigration is a populist dog whistle. But this is not the case in Denmark.

Denmark's approach is gaining some followers in Europe, but also detractors, who accuse it of racism.

## Bulgaria's reformist new PM

After 12 years, Boyko Borisov is out. Kiril Petkov and Assen Vassilev are the new PM and finance minister. Both are Harvard Business grads and entrepreneurs. After serving as interim ministers they started the "We Continue the Change" party, and after winning 26% of the vote in a general in November, have finally managed to pull together a coalition government.

They say that Bulgaria's woes (it is the poorest EU country) are fixable: it just needs to stop being plundered. It has all the attributes of a growth success story.

They will have to move fast and notch up some marks on corruption: much of the extremely corrupt regime they displaced is still in positions of influence.

## French presidential elections

Frances presidential election is in April. Macron is hoping to use France's presidency of the EU Council between January and then as an electioneering tool.

The Council presidency itself is largely procedural. But is a good platform for getting attention. On December 9th he announced a typical avalanche of big ideas. A lofty European ambition was one of the things that won him the presidency in the first place, and he's hoping it will again. The approach might backfire: other countries don't like being the idea of being bossed around by France.

## Oxford-AZ Vaccine

On some measures (number of doses, number of lives saved) AZ is probably the most successful vaccine. It was never intended to be a money printer: Oxford university didn't want it sold at profit. A dose costs $4, compared to $20 for Pfizer.

But AZ will rarely be used for boosters in the UK. And the company's share price gains are not on a par with Pfizer and Moderna.

The FDA hasn't approved it, after AZ failed to notify them about an adverse event in a trial. A failed delivery to the EU meant they ordered Pfizer. It's a adenoviral vector, rather than an mrna vaccine, which has proved less effective at stopping infection, and maybe at preventing death. There were early scares about blood-clots.

AZ is heavily used in India, Mexico and Brazil, and is starting to see use in SE Asia.

## Liz Truss, UK Foreign Secretary

Truss became FS in the September reshuffle. The doctrine is ideological, non-European, global alliance seeking, anti Russia and China. Global Britain. Her Chatham House speech on December 8th was Manichean, almost America: a battle between the free world and the autocracies, with 'non-aligned' states in play. She criticizes a post 1992 'age of introspection'. She is nervous of an America turning inward, and wants to strengthen ties with Australia and India.

The party has made a u-turn on China since 2006, but this is the first time it has been cast as an ideological, rather than a pragmatic, move.

She wants economic diplomacy: a 'network of liberty'. She want into the TPP, and to provide infra spending in poor countries to provide an alternative to China.

Skeptics dislike the 'boosterism' and the overly simplistic patriotic views Truss espouses.

She seems to be good at getting things done. She dislikes abstraction. She is adept at working around Whitehall inertia.

Despite being a supporter of Brexit (though she voted remain), Europhiles believe she will ultimately be a booster of the relationship with Europe: the new cold war will mean the EU are on the side of the angels in her view.

## The Story

<div class="tufte-section">
<div class="main-text">

_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ is a story - a parable really - about an executive team at a Silicon Valley startup. The narrative focuses on Kathryn, the new CEO, an her struggles to fix the problems with the executive team, and as a result with the company. She does this through making the executive team realize that they are dysfunctional - that they suffer from the five dysfunctions - and creating a framework for them to resolve those dysfunctions.

The executive team consists of Jeff (the former CEO), JR (Sales), Mikey (Marketing), Martin (Founder and technology), Carlos (Customer Support), Alex (COO in name, though effectively without a portfolio) and Jan (CFO).

These are the major events of the narrative: Kathryn arrives, and spends two week observing, taking no action except to announce a series of two-day executive retreats. Kathryn responds to various minor rebellions by her team, making her authority clear, but without drama. 

At the first executive retreat the execs are very resistant.Kathryn starts with what will be her mantra, a statement she will with some modification start every offsite with:

> "We have a more experienced and talented executive team than any of our competitors. We have more cash than they do... we have better core technology... Yet in spite of all that, we are behind two of our competitors in terms of both revenue and customer growth..."

Kathryn focuses on establishing trust. Progress is made, and the team at least are no longer dismissive of the effort. They do some simple trust exercises: talking about their personal backgrounds, revealing their weaknesses. Kathryn says that the organization is a political one, defining politics as _"when people choose their words and actions based on how they want others to react rather than based on what they really think."_

Kathryn then pivots to the final dysfunction: Inattention to results. The discussions focuses on the executive's not having any shared goals. Each executive is focused on their own goals rather than those of the company.

The group discusses the role of conflict within a team, that conflict is something that is to be _desired_. It is only through these conflicts, these debates, that real, team-wide, plans and goals can be forged. If the team seeks only to avoid _"interpersonal discomfort"_, then no shared goals, ones that the entire team is _bought in_ on, can be set.

They end the session by agreeing on a single goal to achieve by the end of the year, after a fairly long and open debate: onboard 18 new customers by the end of the year.

The progress at the offsite does not translate to instant success. The book is clear that this is not to be expected. The (in name) COO Alex brings a acquisition proposal to the group. There is skepticism but little debate. Ultimately Kathryn knocks it down after getting Alex to acknowledge that he wants it mainly because he has nothing else to do, and he is worried about how he will explain what he accomplished during his time at the company. Kathryn acknowledges the validity of his concerns and makes his choice clear to him: he can leave and look to his career, or he can stay and help the team succeed as a whole. He stays.

The head of sales, JR, quits. The team decides this is because he doesn't think he can meet the sales goals. Alex, the COO, is rather conveniently a former sales whiz, and agrees to step in.

At the second offsite, the main focus is on Mikey, head of Marketing. She is undeniably extremely good at marketing, but has no emotional intelligence. She is constantly undermining others in the group, acting passive aggressively, and is not buying in to the team-first mentality. Kathryn fires her at the offsite.

Other than this, the second and third offsites are mainly reemphasizing the points of the first. The story finishes a few month later, with everything on track, and everything going well. They all lived happily ever after.

      <h1 class="title">The Cognitive Style of Powerpoint</h1>
    </header>

    <p>In corporate and government bureacracies, the standard method for
      making a presentation is to talk about a list of point organized onto
      slides projected up on the wall. For many years, overhead projectors
      lit up transparencies, and slide projectors showed high-resolution 35mm
      slides. Now "slideware" computer programs for presentations are nearly
      everywhere. Early in the 21st century, several hundred million copies of
      Microsoft were turning our trillions of slides each year.
    </p>
    <p>Alas, slidewhere often reduces the analytical quality of presentations.
      In particular, the popular PowerPoint templates (ready-made designs) usually
      weaken the verbal and spacial reasonaing, and almost always corrupt statistical
      analysis. What is the problem with PowerPoint? And how can we improve our
      presentations?
    </p>

    <p>When Louis Gerstner became president of IBM, he encountered a big company
      caught up in ritualistic slideware-style presentations:

          <p>One of the first meetings I asked for was a briefing on the state of the
            [main-frame computer] business. I remember at least two things about that first
            meeting with Nick Donofrio, who was then running the System/39O business.
            One is that I ... experiences a repeat of my first day on the job. Once again,
            I dfound myself lacking a badge to open the doors at the complext, which housed
            the staffs of all IBM's major product groups, and nobody there knew who I was.
            I finally persuaded a kind soul to let me in, found Nick, and we got started. Sort of</p>
          <p>At that time, the standard format of any important IBM meeing was a
            presentation using overhead projectors and graphics that IBMers called "foils"
            [projected transparencies]. Nick was on his second foil when I stepped to the
            table and, as politely as I could in front of his team, switched off the
            projector. After a long moment of awkward silence, I simply said, "Let's just
            talk about your business"</p>
          <p>I mention this episode because it had an unintended, but terribly powerful
            ripple effect. By that afternoon an e-mail about my hitting the Off button on
            the overhead projector was crisscrossing the world. Talk about consternation!
            It was as if the President of the United States had banned the use of English
            at White House meetings.<a id="fnref1" class="footnote-ref" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>There is  lot going on here: the humiliation ceremony authorizing entry
      into the Coporate Palace, a new president symbolically demonstrating
      that things were going to be different from now on, and a blunt action
      indicating that there might be better ways to do serious analysis than
      reading aloud from projected lists - <em>"Let's just talk about your business."</em></p>

    <h2>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="main-text">
        <p>Gerstner's idea, <em>"Let's just talk about your business,"</em> means an exchange of
          information, an interplay betwee speaker and audience. Yet PowerPoint
          is entirely <em>presenter-oriented</em>, and <em>not content-oriented, not audience-oriented.</em>
          The claims of PP marketing are addressed to speakers: "A cure for the
          presentation jitters." "Get yourself organized." "Use the AutoContent Wizard
          to figure out what you want to say." The fans of PowerPoint are presenters, rarely audience members</p>
        <p>Slideware helps speakers to outline their talks, to retrueve and show
          diverse visual materials, and to communicate slides in talks, printed reports, and internet. And also
          to replace serious analysis with chartjunk, over-produced layouts, cheerleader logotypes and branding, and corny
          clip art. That is, PowerPointPhluff.</p>
        <p>PP convenience for the speaker can be costly to both content and
          audience. These costs results from the <em>cognitive style characteristicx of the
            standard default PP presentation:</em> forshortening of evidence and thought,
          lower spatial resolution, a deeply hierarchical single-path structure as the model
          for organizing every type of content, breaking up narrative and data into slides and minimal
          fragments, rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis, conspicious
          decoration and Phruff, a preoccupation with format not content, an attitude of commercialism that
          turns everything into a sales pitch.</p>

    <h2>Extremely Low Resolution of PowerPoint</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <div class="main-text">
        <p>PP slides projected up on the wall are very low resolution - compared to
          paper, 35mm slides, and the immensely greater capacities of the human
          eye-brain system. Impoverished space leads to over-generalizations,
          imprecise statements, slogans, lightweight evidence, abrupt and thinly-
          argued claims. For example, this slide from a statistics course shows a
          seriously incomplete statement. Probably the <em>shortest true statement</em>
          that can be made about causality and correlation is <em>"Empirically observed
            covariation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for causality."</em> Or perhaps
          <em>Correlation is not causation, but it sure is a hint."</em> Many true statements
          are too long to fit on a PP slide, but this does not mean we should abbreviate the truth to make the words fit.
          It means we should find a better way to make presentations.
